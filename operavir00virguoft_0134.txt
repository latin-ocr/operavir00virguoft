dative instead of the preposition ab and an ablative3 but if we wish to
retain the force of the dative, we may translate here, “ 1 am an object
of contempt to thee.'’

nec qui sim (lucet-is. See note on Ecl. Ι. 19, “iste deus qui sit.”

20. dives pecoris, “ rich in cattle? Cf, AEn. IX. 26,

Dives equum, dives pictai vestis et auri.
Also with an ablativo ; Hor. Sat. 1. ii. 13,
Dives agris, dives positis in foenore nummis.

22. mihi . . . defit, “ fails me.” The passive of facere is fieri; but in
the compounds we meet with passive forms made in the usual way,
dficio, deficior, &c. Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. VII. 50) says, ‘⁸ quem
vires deficiunt; '⁹ and Bell. Civ. III. 64, “quum gravis vulnere esset
adfectus aquilifer, et a viribus deficeretur.” But the old form of the
passive is defieri .· as Ter. Eun. II. ii. 12, “nil defit tamen.'' We may
further remark, that the active form deficere is often used in an in-
transitive sense 3 as Caesar, Bell. Gall. III. 5, “ quum non solum vireS,
sed etiam tela nostris deficerent.’'

23. quoe solitus se. cantare, “what (Amphion) was accustomed to
sin .'’
2g4. Amphion Dircaezts. Amphion was a king of Thebes, and the hus-
band of Niobe: marvellous stories are told of the wonderful effects
produced by the sound of his lyre3 not only did the oxen follow him,
but the very stones obeyed the strain. He is said to have killed him-
self for grief, because his children had been slain by Apollo and Diana.
The sorrow of his wife Niobe formed a very tragic subject, which poets
and sculptors worked out with great effect. Dirce was a relative of the
family, who had ill-used Amphion's mother, Antiope; Amphion tied
her to a bun, and allowing her to be dragged about till she died, he
threw the body into a well, which took the name of “ Dirce.’' This
well was near Thebes in Boeotia3 and so the term ‘¹ Dircaean ” is often
used poetically for Boeotian. See Smith's Diet. Biog, art. Amphion3
and cf. Ovid. Met. VI. 266—312.

in Actoeo Aracyntho. The mountain Aracynthus which is best
known was in Acarnania or AEtolia; but there is no evidence that
Amphion was ever in that part of the country. Therefore the com-
nientators maintain that the Aracynthus here referred to was upon the
bordei-s of Boeotia and Atticag and they explain Actaeo, by saying that
it alludes to an old name Ἀκταία, or the Coast-Iand, a name given to
Attica, and derived from ἀκτὴ, “ a shore, or promontory-’³ Thus they
say, that “ Actaean Aracynthus '³ means Aracynthus of Attica, or near
Attica.

25. nec sum adeo informis, “nor am I so very unshapely :” here the
negative in has the force of “ ill ;” “ ill-shapen‚ ‘im-handsome, ugly.'’
See note on v. 4, incondita.

nuper me in lictore vidi. This must mean that he saw himself reflected
in the water 3 and objections have been raised, that there was no need
to go to the sea-shore, and stand in littore, when a brook or lake would
have served just as well, or perhaps better. The fact is that Virgil has
borrowed from Theocritus <Idyll. VI. 34), and the only question is,
whether Virgil has translated fairly, or whether he has spmled the
