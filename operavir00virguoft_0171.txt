100. solstitia. solstitium is, strictly, the time when the sun (sol)
appears to stand (stare) still; namely, either in Cancer or Capricorn.
It is, however, very generally restricted to “ the summe1·-solstice,” and
is so opposed to ὀνῆιηα (= brerima = brevissima), which is the common
term for “the winter-solstice.'’ By the figure called synecdoche—the
putting of a prominent part, merely, for the whole-solsticium is
sometimes put for oestas ‚· just like carina for navis, tectam for domus.
It may be so taken here.

102, 103. tantum, “ so much” as it does. The extraordinary fertility
of Mysia is attributed by the poet, not to superiority of culture, but to

“ So when a pensant to his garden brings
Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,
And calls the floods from high to bless his bowers,
And seed with pregnant streams the plants and fioxvers ;
soon as he clears whate’er their passage stay’d,
And marks their future current with his spade,
Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills
Louder and louder purl the falling rills,
Before him scatt'ring they prevent his pains,
And shine in mazy wand'rings o‘er the plains.”—POPE.

115. incestis mensibus. That is, in autumn and spring* when the
weather is variable and uncertain.

by men and oxen in tilling the earth‚—do vile geese and Strymonian
cranes and succory with bitter root present no hindrance or the
shade of trees inflict no damage. The Father [i.e.‚ Jupiter] himself ’
