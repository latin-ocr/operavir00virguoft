ancient manuscripts; and seems to suppose densissimus imber to be the
nominative case to planqz'c. If this interpretation be admitted, we
must render the passage now under consideration thus: “The south
winds redouble ς and the exceeding thick shower now makes the woods,
and now the shores resound.'’ He adds “that in the Medicean copy
plangunt is paraphrased scindunt .· thus the verb must agree both with
auster and imber.'’ But to say either that the skower, or the south wind
and the shower make the woods and shores resound wit-h a ριν-ραι wind,
seems to me to be a tautology. If we were to admit planyit, I should
rather, with Mr. B——, understand J upiter; though I think he is mis-
taken in ascribing this interpretation to Pierius. Masvicius also has
admitted plangit: but as planyunt seems to be full as good as the
other reading, and as it is generally received, Ι have chosen to adhere
to it. (Mart vn.)

337. igni-s >Cyllenius Mercury is called the Cyllenian fire, partly
with reference to his dazzling white light, partly with respect to his
birth-place, Mount Cyllene in Arcadia.

347—350. “Nor let any one apply the sickle under the ripe ears of
corn, before that—his temples garlanded with the wreathed oak-he
dances in unartistic measures and sings songs to Ceres? This is
another festival observed shortly before harvest. WVreaths of oak were
worn in honour of Ceres, because she first taught mankind the use of
corn instead of acor‘ns. Compare verses 7 and 8 above.

356—359. continuo ventis, &c- It is more easy to admire than
describe the beauty of these lines of our poet. The very motion of the
swelling sea is expressed in these words, which seem to rise gradually
with the waves:

. . . freta ponti
Incipiunt agitata tumescere.

We have the crackling of the mountains in

. . . aridus altis
Montibus audiri fragm-3

and the rustling of the woods in “nemorum increbrescere murmur.'’
These beauties are too frequent in Virgil to escape the observation of
most readers. (Martyn.)

360. Some editions insert the preposition a before curvi-‘35 but this is
against the authority of the great majority of MSS. There are other
examples of temperare followed by an ablative without a preposition;
as in Livy, XXX. xx. 1, and XXXII. xxxiv, 3.—carinz's is by synecdoche
for navibus. Translate, ‘⁶ now can the wave hardly restrain itself from
the rounded ships ;'' that is, refrain from swamping them.

With difficulty then the billows spare
The crooked ships,· when flying nearer land
The swift—wing'd cormorants forsake the deep,
And send their screams before them to the beach.
Tra
E'en then the doubtful billows scarce abstain pp·
From the toss'd vessel on the troubled main :
When crying cormorants forsake the sea,
And stretching to the covert wing their way.
Dryden.
