 

THE BUCOLICS.—-ECLOGUE IV. 137

chent-ships will disappear3 there will be no need for commerce,
because each land will produce everything.

38. cedet ec ipse mari vector, “ even the very carrier will leave the sea,'’
i.e. there will be no carrying of merchandise from one country to
another. Mari is the ablative denoting motion from. We find cedere e
patrici, but also cedere patrici, cedcre Italici, &c. ,· and in commercial
language cedere soro, “ to quit the exchange‚'' meant ‘⁴ to become
baukru t.”

42. oiientiri colore& “ to eounterfeit colours : ’' the accusative with
'mentiri occurs in Martial, Epigr. III. 43, “ mentiris juvenem tinctis
capillis,’' ‘⁴ you dye your hair and try to play the young man.’' virgil
111 another passage speaks of dyeing wool as a defilement of its native
purity. See Geo. ΙΙ. 465, “ alba neque Assyrio fucatur lana veneno‚''
“ nor is white wool bedyed with Syrian drug.''

43. ipse. See note on v. 21, “ipsae.”—suave rubenti. See note on
Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 63, “suave rubens hyacinthus.'’

44. jam murice. jam, &c.‚ ⁴⁴ will tinge his fieece now with purple, now
with saffron-coloured woad ,· ” i.e., the wool as it grows upon the
sheep’s back will assume fanciful colours. Virgil is so anxious to do
away with artificial dyeing, that he makes the gaudy colours grow
naturally. Notice the use of mutabit: in general this verb is followed
by the accusative of the thing given, and the ablative of the thing
received, as' mutare porcos aere, “ to change pigs for money,'' i.e., to sell
pigs: or sometimes conversely “ to take in exchange,” as Hor. Od. I.
xvii. 1, “ saepe Lucretilem mutat Lycaeo FaunuS‚” zle„ leaves Lycaeus
and goes to Lucretilis. But in the passage of Virgil there is no
exchange at all3 the ram does not change his fleece for purple, but
varies or tinges it with purple : aud so Heyne explains it “ permutabit,
tin et, inficiet.”

4g5. sponte sud, “ ofits own free will : ’¹ so we find meti sponte, tud. sponte,
and still more frequently suli sponte. Caes. B. G. Ι, 44, “ transisse Rhenum
sese non sua sponte :'’ Georg. ΙΙ. 11, “ipsae sponte sua veuiunt.’' The use
of sponte without a pronoun is to be found, but the addition of the pro-
noun is more common—sandyx or sandix, Gr. σάνδυξ and σάνδιξ. Τ110
critics are not agreed about this word z in such a case, the best plan is
to go back to the authority of the ancients themselves, and to take
their evidence on matters of fact, putting aside all modern conjectures.
'Now Pliny tells us (Nat. Hist. XXXV. 22-23)‚ that if you take
sandaraca (red sulphuret of arsenio Ζ), and expose it to beat, and then
mix it with equal portions of red ochre, you make saudyae. Although,
says he, I perceive that Virgil took it for a plant, in that line, “ Sponte
sua sandyx pascentes vestiet agnos.'' Thus, according to Pliny, sandyx
is a chemical substance used in colouring, and he accuses Virgil of
mistaking it for a plant. But Virgil does not actually call it such;
he merely says that ‘¹ sandyx will clothe the lambs 3 ” though what he
meant by sandyz, is rather difficult to guess.

46. talia, &e Heyue interprets, ‘'Pal-eze dixerunt suis fusis, Ο talia
saecla currite ! '' The Parcae or Destinies are represented as spinning
the thread of human life, or the thread of fate: hence, when they
allow their spindles to run quickly round, they are supposed to hasten
the course of events. Compare Catull. LXlV. 328, ⁴· currite ducentes
subtemina, currite fusi.” Virgil gives a turn to the expression: he
