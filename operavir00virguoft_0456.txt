124—130. cavebant, “ f01=etold.’'—-tectus = dissimulans—opponere
morti, “ to doom him to drathfl—eomposv'to. The most common formula
is ecc composito or (Ic composito. We have composito in Cornelius Nepos,
Datames, VL: “perfugas mala fide compositoque fecisse‚'’ &e—con-
versa tulere is said by most commentators to be equivalent to converterunt.
But may not tulere here have 1116 sense of ‘¹ bore, tolerated 2‘’ If so we
may translate, “ all acquiesced, and what each dreaded sor himself, they
bore [or ‘they were unconccrncd at'] when they found it directed to
the ruin of one uuhappy wretch.”

136. In this line Ι have retained the punctuation of Heyne, which
Wagner has rejected: “until they should bave sailed, if haply they
should sail.’' For it was uncertain whether the Greeks would sail
away, since they hrd been prcvented from offering up the enjoined
sacrifice by the ssight of their victim.

173-175. “ scarcely was the statue [i e. the stolen Palladium]
placed in the camp, when glistening flames flashcd forth from her
glaring eye-balls, and salt sweat trickled o’er her limbs, and thrice
she herself (wonderful to relate ¹.) sprung froin the ground, bearing
[ἶ arnicd with] her shield and quivering spca1·.”——emiczoit -- exsiliit.

178 For οφητιιά in this line substitute the reading omina, and
translate, “unless they repeat [or ‘take again’] the omens at Argos,
and carry back [fmn Greece to Troy] the divinity which they have
convcyed with thein.'' According to a Roman cwtom, which Vix—gil
here attributes to the heroic period, the generals, on any great military
disaster being sustained or threatening prognostic being observed,
returned from their camp back to their own country? in order to
consult the auspices anew, and afterwards, with the gods concfflated,
continued their operations against the enemy—The Palladium is here
called numen, inasmuch as the statue of Minerva is identified with the
goddess herself. A fcw lines previously the image has been repre-
sented as giving indications of her feelings. The relative sentence

fresh auspices.
