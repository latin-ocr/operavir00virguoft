1. Quid faciat. The subjunctive is due to the circumstance that we
have here a dependent question. (See Latin Delectus, p. 86, and
elsewhere.) The direct question would be Quid facit Zaetas seyetes,

“what makes—07, what is it that makes—the cr‚’0ps ’&.c In sucha.
dependent claus se as we have 111 the text, the subjunctive ( faciat) alone
is admissible. There is, therefore nothing to necessitate the em p-loy
ment of‘ ‘may ’' or‘ ‘’'can 111 rendering it into English. -laetas. The
ordlual y signification of this word 1s,“of joyful aspectf' (See note
at the foot of p. 26 of Latin DelectuS.) It is here applied figuratively
to the flourishing, luxuriant appearance of an abundant crop of corn.
This and similar usages of the word are not uncommon. Compare
Cicero, de Or. III. 38, “ Laetas segetes etiam metiri dicunt ; ’⁷ and verse
69 of this Georgia. Compare also Psalm lxv. 14.-—se9etes. The term seyes
is applied sometimes to the growing corn itself, sometimes to the field
in which it grows—quo sidere, “under what sign, or constellation ; ’' 111
other words, “at what season—whenf'*

2. vertere terram, sc. aratra—Maecenas. This was C. Cilnius Maecenas,
the prime minister of the Emperor Augustus, the encourager and pro·
moter of literature and the arts, and the friend and patron of Virgil,
Horace, and many other men of genius.

3. The alliteration observable in this line is anything but harmonicus:
“ Conveniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo.'’ With cultus habendo
(dative of gerund) sit pecori, compare Georg. ΙΙ. 178, “quae sit rebus
natura ferendis.”

4. pecori. Pecus (G. pecb‘rz's) generally stands for a herd of cattle,
particularly for a fiock of the smaller kinds of farm stoek, as sheep,
swine, &c. Pecus (G. pecadis) commonly means a sinyle head of such
cattle. Observe the hiatus 111 pecori apibus. The Virgilian hexameter
readily admits hiatus in the arsis of the second, third, fourth, or fifth
soot3 especially (i) in the case osa proper name3 or (ii) when a stop

θ “ I think nothing which is a phrase or saying in common talk should be
admitted into a serious poem ; because it takes off from the solemnity of the
expression, and gives it too great a turn of sanniliariry; much less ought the
low phrases and terms of art that are adapted to husbandry, to have any place in
such a work as the Georgic, which is not to appear in the natural simplicity
and nakedness of its subject, but in the pleasantest dress that poetry can
bestow on it. Thus virgil, to deviate from the common form of words,
would not make use of tempore, but sidere, in his first verse; and every
where else abounds with metaphors‚ Grecisms, and circumlocutione, to give his
verse the greater pomp, and preserve it from sinking into a plebeian style.
And hercin consists Virgil’s masterpiece, who has not only excelled all other
poc-ts, but even himself, in the language of his Georgics; where we receive
more strong and lively ideas of things from his words, than we could have
done from the objects themselve83 and find our imaginations more affected by
his dcscriptions than they would have been hythe very sight of what he
describes.''—Anmsou. The poetry ofthc expression referred tois completely
destroyed by Dryden, who translates simply “ when.” Dr. Trapp's version is
more. spirited:

that makes the fields rcjoice ; beneath what stara
To turn the glebe5 &c-
