instead of merely the ancestress of Caesan—tempora. The entire human
race are represented as decking the brow of Caesarwith the myrtle ; that
18, as wreathing the statues of him which will be erected, in the event
of his electing to become a deity presiding over the earth.

30. ultima Thule. Strictly, the Shetland islands; but here used to
denote the extremest boundary of the sea.

33. qua locus. Tlris place between the Virgin and the Scorpion is
now occupied by Libra—Erigyonen. Erigone, the daughter of Icarius,
hung herself upon hearing of the death of her father, and became the
constellation Virgo—Chelas (χηλάς), “ the claws '¹ of the Scorpion.

36. Tartara. This is a neuter plural from the masculine singular,
Tartarus. So we have Pcrfsama from Pei-ymnus, &c. Nouus of this
class—that is, which are of one gender in the singular and of a different
gender in the plural—are called heteroclite. Compare note on δεσμά,
p. 32, 1. 5, of the editor's “ Select Dialogues of Lucian.’'

43—49. ‘⁴ In early spring, when the cold moisture is being distilled
upon the snow-capped hiIIs, and the crumbling soil unbound by
Zephyrus, even so soon as that, in my opinion, the bull ought to begin
to groan under the down-pressed plough, and the share to glitter with
the friction of the furrow. That field, and only that, gives an answer
to the prayers of the eager farmer, which twice has felt the sun, twice
the cold z its abundant crops are wont to burst the grauaries.”

43. canis. Observe that cauis, from the adjective scium, has the α
long; whilst the substantive crinis, “ a dog,'⁷ has the a short.

44. se resolvit is much the same as resolvitur. Zephyro is the ablativo
of cause.

47. seyes has here the meaning of the corn-field itself, not the crop
growing on it. It is to this word seyes that illias at the beginning of
line 49 has 1616161166- demum, literaHy, “ at length, at last.'' has often
the force of“alone, only.’' Ille demum means ⁴· he, at last? to the rejection
of all others, that is, “ he, and 116 alone.'' Compare Sallust, Cataline, H.

plough their fallowing-land ‘thrice a year, first, in spring, when it
was ploughed deep, secondly, in summer, when it was ploughed cross-

certain kinds of soil, they gave it a preparatory ploughing in the
autumn of the preceding year, so that the ground should be twice
exposed to the heat of summer and twice to the frosts of winter.

be our carc to ascertain the winds, and the varying nature of the atmo-
