136 NOTES ON

23. cunabala. This may be rendered “the cradle,'’ or “the birth-
plaee.’' Cf. AEn. Ι. 105, “mons Idaeus ubi et gentis cunabula
nostrae.”

24. herba veneni, “the herb of poison‚” for “the poisonous herb.''
This use of the genitive for au adjective is very common in the Oriental
languages‚ as, for example, in Hebrew “a tower of strength'’1neans
“a strong tower 3 ’' “ the mountain of holiness '’ is “ the hely moun-
tain.'' Such expressions are constantly occurring in the Psalms of
David.

25. amomum„- the precise name of this plant has not been exactly
ascertained : it is enough for us to know that it was an aromatis: plant
from which a fragrant baleam was prepared. It is described by Pliny,
XII. xiii. 28 ; it occurs also in Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 89, “ferat et rubus asper
amomum.’'

26. facta Parentis. The commentators have puzzlcd themselves to
know who this father was 3 but as they are not agreed about the identity
of the son, still less can they ascertain the father3 there is a various
reading parentum, which gets over the difficulty without solving it.

27. qztoe sit virtus, “what virtue (or manliness) is.'’ Here we have
the subjunctive in an indirect question. See note upon Ecl. Ι. 19, ·‘ iste
deus qui sit.” Virtus is derived from vir, and means “manliness” in
the highest sense, or, as Shakespeare calls it, “ good manhood.'' Virgil
intends to say that when he is first beginning to conceive manly
thoughts and feelings, there will be a gradual development of pros·
perity upon earth.

28. molli arista, “with soft (or downy) axvnss’ arista is properly the
“awn'’ or ‘⁴ heard '¹ of corn, and contains the same root as the German
achre, the Anglo-Saxon aekher or ear, and the English ειη-(1100111).
The position of the adjective molli is emphatic, and implies that the
awn will not be bristling as at present, but soft aud downy.

30. sudabunt, “ will sweat out, or exude.'' This transitive use of the
verb occurs again, Ecl. VIII. 54, ‘¹ pinguia corticibus sudent electra
myricae.'’—roscida, “dewlike, dropping like dew.”

31. suberunt, “will be lurking, or lingering.’' The phrase “subest
suspicio ’⁵ sometimes occurs3 ‘⁶ there is a lurkiug suspicion?

32. qaae tenum-c jubeant, “such as will bid men try‚” ἀρ. The sub-
junctive here denotes a consequence ; there will yut be such traces of
old iniquity asto make men follow their former pu1·.<11it.÷.—Tl20sis was a
sea-nymph, daughter of Nereus⁹ aud mother of Achilles. The word is
here used poetically for “ the sea.”

34. alter erit tam Taplzys, ‘⁶ there will be then a second Tiphys.”
We have already seen that aller means “ one of two‚⁷' and it is often
used to mean “the second.’' The ordinal numbers run, primus, alser,
tertius, quartuS, &c.; and alter eyo means “ a second self.’' Tiphys
was the pilot of the ship Argo. For the story of the ship Argo and the
Argonautis: expedition, see Sinith's Biog. Dion, art. “ A1·gonau†ae,'’ and
compare Ovid, Met. VIL-—et altera quw vellat, &e.‚ “ and a second Argo
to carry the chosen heroes-⁷⁵ The subjunctive vehat denotes a purpose;
in such instances the relative pronoun and a subjunctive mood may
best be translated by the English infinitive.

37. ltine, “henceforth, hereafter.'’ then the boy has arrived at
complete manh00d‚ there will not only be uo war-ships but even mer-
