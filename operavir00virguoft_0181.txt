GEORGIC 1. ’ 171

were depicted the scene of danger and the escape of the thank-offerers;
whilst the clothes which they had worn on the occasion, hung up with
the tablet, completed the memorial of their deliverance.

447. Aurora had fallen in love with and carried off the beautiful
Tithonus, the son of Laomedon, king of Troy. With the passage in the
text, compare Homer, Od. V. 1 ;

Ἠὼς δ’ ἐκ λεχέων παρ’ ἀγαυοῦ Τιθωνοῖο
Ὄρνυτο.
and Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis ς

And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in true majesty.

454. immiscet-ier is an older form of the infinitive immisceri. So we
have ace—inqier for accinqi in AEn. IV. 493; farier for fari in AEn. XI.
2423 and in Lucretius, Terence, Plautus, and other old writers, there is
a coustant recurrence of such forms.

456. fervere is here of the third conjugation, with present indicative
fervo. It is the same in meaning as the more usual fervere, with present
indicative ferveo,

466-468. “He [the sun] also pitied Rome at the murder of Caesar,
when he enveloped his beamy head in dusky dinginess, and impious
mortals dreaded an eternal night.'’ Having just observed that the sun
foretels wars and tumults, he takes occasion to mention the prodigious
paleness of the sun after the death of Julius Caesar. Then he digresses
into a beautiful account of the other prodigies which are said to have
appeared at the same time. But though he represents these extraor-
dinary appearances as consequences of the murder of Caesar, yet at the
same time he shows that they predicted the civil war of Augustus and
Antony against Brutus and Cassius. The reader cannot but observe
how judiciously Virgil takes care to show that he had not forgotten the
subject of his poem in this long digression. At the close of it he
introduces a husbandman in future ages ploughing up the field of
battle, and astonished at the magnitude of the bones of those who had
been there buried. (Martyn.)

474 sqq. Compare Shakspeare, Julius Caesar, ΙΙ. ii.;

Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,

In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Whjch drizzled blood upon the Capitol;

The noise of battle hurtled in the air,

Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,

And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.

With the entire description of Virgil may be compared also Act Ι.
scene iii.; and the speech of Lennox in Macbeth, II. iii.
487. Thunder in a cloudless sky was looked upon by the ancients as
a prodigy. Compare Horace, Od. Ι. xxxiv. 5-8 ;
. . . Namque Diespiter,
Igni corusco nubila dividens
Plerumque, per purum tonantes
Egit equos volucremque currum :

“For Jupiter, who usually rives the clouds with his fiashing fire, has

driven his thundering steeds through a clear sky.'' 2
