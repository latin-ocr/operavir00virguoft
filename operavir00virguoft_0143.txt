THE sueonos—nomem: 1v. 133

„ 103. fascinat, “bewitchesl' This looks like the Greek βασκαίνειν,

which means, “to use ill-words, to belie,’' and also to “employ evil
s ›ells.”

1 104. dic quibus, δια, “tell me in what lands the space of heaven ex-
tends for no more than three elln.'’ Heyne explains this rustic riddle
of Damoetas, by supposing him to allude to the bottom of awell, where
the view is limited by the circumference of the well's mouth.

106. dic quibus . . ,flores ,· a reference is made to the fancy that upon
the petals of the hyacinth the letters AI, ΑΙ (“ alas, alas '') may be
traced, and that these letters were a lamentation for the death of Hya-
cinthus. Cf. Ovid, Met. XIII. 398,

Littera communis mediis vpueroque viroque
Inscripta est foliis: haec nominis, illa querelae,

where Ovid refers the legend to Ajax (Greek A'a'as).—iozsc›”ipti nomina .-
here the accusative depends upon the passive participle inscripti. See
note on Ecl. Ι. 55, “ florem depasta?

109. ιι vitula, &c. He means that both were worthy of the prize.
Cf. Theocr. VI. 46,

Νίκη μὰν οὐδ’ ἄλλος, ἆνάσσατοι δ’ ἐγένοντο.

ECLOGUE IV.-—POLLIO.

The poet commences by proposing to sing upon sublimer themes
than those of ordinary pastoral poetry (v. 1—3)‚ and then bursts out in
the annunciation of a new era fraught with happiness to the world. A
child shall be born, under whom the blessings of the golden age will
be restored to mankind. The beginning of this new epoch will date
from the consulship of Pollio (v. 11), and the depravity of the human
race will gradually disappear. The boy, whose advent is promised, will
eventually rule over a peaceful world (v, 17) : but even at his birth all
nature will rejoice, the earth will put forth her fairest flowers, while the
wild animals will lose their natural ferocity, and all that is hurtful or
poisonous will be destroyed (v. 18—25). As soon as this auspicious
child has arrived at years of intelligence‚ there will be an increase of
prosperity ; although some few traces of former iniquity will remaiu
(v. 26ssss6). But when he has attained the full age of manhood, there
will be complete and unmingled happiness all over the world; every
land will be adorned with the richest productions, no labour will be
required on the part of man, but universal prosperity will be found
(v. 37—45). The poet concludes by an earnest prayer that the blessed
time may speedily draw nigh, that he may live to See it, and that he
may be able to celebrate in verse the glories of the coming day.

Such is the substance of the Eclogue. The consulship of Pollio was
in the year 714 U.o.‚ or 40 Bic.; the consuls of that year being Cn.
Domitius Calvinus and C. Asinius Pollio. In this year the peace of
Brundusium was concluded between Caesar Octavianus and Marcus
Antonius, and Pollio had a share in bringing about that accommodation.
Octavia, the sister of Octavianus, was married to Antonius, and some
