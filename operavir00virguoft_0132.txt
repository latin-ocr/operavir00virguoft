1 22 NOTES oN

Seri. vii. 25. “nec vero dubitet agricola quamvis senex quaerenti :m
«serat. respondere, diis immortalibus,” &e

74. insere may mean either “plant,'’ or “ingraftss' The verse θη
=ironical ; “ Go on, Meliboeus, plant <or ingraft) your pear-trees, set your
vlnes m rows.”

75. felix pecus capellce. See note on v. 14.

76. viridiprojectas in antro. see note on v. 53.

77. dumosa (le rupe pendere, ‘⁶ clinging to the bushy rock.”

78. me pascente, “while I am their Shepherd.'' So Eel. IV. 78,
“A1·0adiajudice;” Ecl. 11. 27, ‘⁶ te judice; '' aud Juv. X. 122,

Ο fortunatam natam me consule Romam,

“ under my consulship.’'
80. poteras requies-cere. Some read poteris, but the best MSS. have

poteras: “You might have rested,’' (2) or, “ you might as well rest3 ”
the latter interpretation is the more probable. Cf. ovid, Met. Ι. 679,
“at tu . . . hoc poteras mecum considere saXO,⁷' where some editions
read poteris. See also Hor. Od. Ι. xxxvii. 4, “ nunc esc bibendum ; nunc
ornare pulvinar deorum tempus erat.”

ECLOGUE IL—ALEXIS.

1. ardebat Alexim delicias domini, “burned (with love) for Alexis,
the darling of his master.’' Cf. Hor. Od. ΙΙ. iv. 7,

Arsit Atrides medio in triumpho
Virgine rapta ;

and with the accusative, id. Od, IV. ix. 13, “non sola comptos arsit
adulteri crines,” *Sco—deliciae are “ allurements, delights ;” probably
from de, and the root lac, “d1·aw,”whieh is found 111 elicio, illicio,-
hence the word is applied to beloved objects, 01· persons ε “ tu urbanus
scurra, delieiae popli,” Plaut. Most. Ι. 1. 14; “Titus amor ac deliciae
generis humani,” Suet. Tit. i. 1. Cf. Ecl. IX. 22.

[nec quid speraret habebat. Here quid is not used poetically for quod,
as Heyne thinks, nor is it an old form, as Voss supposes. lVagner has
along note upon the passage. He lays down a distinction between
habeo quod and habeo quid. Thus, habeo quod sperem, “ I have some-
thing to hope f0r;'' habeo quid sperem, “I may perhaps have some
hope ; '' non habebam quod sperarem, ‘⁴ I had no hope 3 ’' non habebam
quid sperarem, “ I knew not what Ι could possibly hope for.‘' Perhaps
the simplest explanation is to give ‘non habebat the force of “he had
not in his mind,’' ‘⁴ he could not tell‚” and so to make quid speraret an
indirect question, like the common form nesciebat quid speraret]

3. cacumina, “tree-tops,” a word qualifyiug fa908,—as we should
say, “ with their shady tree-tops.'’ Cacumen is the “ sharp point
of anything,'’ Greek ἂκ-μή, with which compare ἅκ-ρον, lin-pa, &c. aud
