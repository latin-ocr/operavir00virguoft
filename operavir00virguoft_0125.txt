ECLOGUE 1.—T1TYRUS.

ARGUMENT.-Tffis Eelogue is in the form of a dialogue between two
rustics. Meliboeus has been turned out of his farm, and appears
driving his goats in search of a new home, when he sees Tityrus peace-

’ fully reposing under the shade of a tree. Tityrus relates the manner

m which he obtained his prosperity : he went to Rome for the
sake of procuring his liberty, and gained from his master permission to
feed his flock in safety (v. 45). Meliboeus laments his own bitter fate,
and denounces the rapacity of those veteran soldiers who have been
let loose upon the country people.

The commentators say, that in this Eelogue there is a direct allusion
to the fortunes of Virgil himself. After the defeat of Brutus and
Cassius, the veteran troops were presented with lands as a reward for
their services. In many cases these lands had belonged to partisans of
the defeated faction 3 and much misery was brought upon those who
were thus dispossessed of their property. The people about Mantua
and Cremona—among them Virgil himself—suffered considerably.

It would seem that, upon the advice of Asinius Pollio, governor of
Gallia Transpadana, he went to Rome and recovered his lands by the
favour of Octavianus Caesar (afterwards called Augustus). If this
account be correct, we may infer that Virgil wrote this Eclogue, to
commemorate the circumstance, and to testify his gratitude.

1. patuloe faffl', “ of the spreading beech tree.” So σκιερὴν ὑπὸ φηγόν,
Theocritus, XII. 8.-Pa1ulus is derived from patere, “to lie flat, to lie
open.” [Compare the English “flat,” German “platt,'’ and Greek
πλατύς.] The termination ulus is found in some adjectives derived
from verbs, as bibulus, “ drinking, fond of drink ;’' credulus, “ trustful ;”
{sal-melus, “ ohattering;” {ser-ulus, ‘⁸ ca1·1·ying.''—— Fassus seems to be the
same with the Greek φηγός ; but modern eritics explain the latter word
to mean a kind of oalc.

2. [silvestrem tenui. It is very common in virgil to find two adjec-
tives and two substantives in the same line: the position of these
adjectives and substantives is worth notice. Sometimes, as here, the
two adjectives are together3 at other times the adjectives and substan-
tives are intermingled. Compare v. 50, 51 :

Non insueta graves tentabunt pabula foetas,
Nec mala vicini pecoris contagia laedent.
