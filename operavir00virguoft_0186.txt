order in which they occur, employing some such form for quantus . . .

long days [i. e. of summer], that [073 so much] the cool dew will replace
in the short night [of the same season].” This is an exaggeration of

was hidden among the grass. He does not say whether the pole was
stuck into the ground perpendicularly, or merely left lying. If he

between every two rows. Ordinibus is the dative case.— in unyuem,
“ accurately, exactly.'’ This expression is borrowed from sculptors
who tested the smoothness and neatness of their work by passing their
nail over it. Similarly Horace, Sat. I. v. 32, “ Fontejus ad unguem
factus homo ;’' and Ars Poetica, 294, “Carmen perfectum decies casti-
gare ad unguem.”

a competent time, else the vermin, snails, and insects which they pro-
duce and shelter, will gnaw, and greatly injure their bark, and there-
fore to lay a coat of moist rotten litter with a little earth upon it, will
preserve it moist in summer, and warin in winter, enriching the showers
