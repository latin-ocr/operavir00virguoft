94. O terque quaterque beati. Cf. Hom. Od. E. 306; τρὶς μάκαρες
Δαναοί, κ,τ.λ.

96. Qneis conlinit, “whose happy lot it was.” Omfflnyere, ‘· to
happen,’' is chiefly used of fortunate occurrences; accidere to unfor-
tum-te, or, at best, indifferent events; evenire. “to turn out, to
evemuate, to happen,” is applied either to favoni-able or uufavourable
contingencies.—opprtere. Understand mortem. Obirc is frequently used
with a similar ellipsiS.

97. Tydide. It was only by the coming of Venus to his rescue
that AEneas escaped the death by which he was threatened at the
hand of Diomedes, the son of Tydeus, with whom he had engaged in
connbat. See Homer, ΙΙ. E. 239-318.—jb2-tissi212‚e. Compare Iliad. Z. 98.
where Helenus speaks of Diomedes ; ὃν δὴ ἐγὼ κάρτιστον Ἀχαιῶν φημὶ
γενέσθαι.

99, 100 scmus Hector. The epithet saevus, when applied to a warrior,
is nearly equivalent to, hut snmewhat stronger than fortis, acer, ἀρ. It
ma)⁷ be rendered “dre-acl, dreadful, valian†.¹' So the Homeric epithets
δεινός. αἰνός, ἀπηνής-,ω AEacidoe. Achilles, the son of Peleus, was callfd
AEacides as being the grandson of AEacus. As the son of Peleus, he
waS, of course, called Peleides.—telo=hasta. Il. X. 319.-—jacet, κεῖται.-
Sarpedon. A Lycian prince, slain by Patroclus—ubi tot Simois. Cf.
Hom. Il. M. 2³2, ⁴23. The Simois has its rise in Mount Ida, and fiows
into the river Scamander or Xanthus.

102. jactanti. Jactare, when used in this sense, differs from diem-e,
in as far as it implies passion or strong emotion on the part of the
speak-e1·.—az·ertic=avertit se.

104, 105. The northern blast caused the ship’s head to fall off, and
the vessel to present her broadside to the waves. This is the most
trying position for a. ship in a heavy sea. There appears to be very
little reason for suppos-ing, with some commentators, that undis dett
lalus means that the vessel is thrown over on her beam-ends.

106. Ιιί .. . lale, “these . . . those.'' The persons on board are spoken
of, instead of the ships.

109. Aras. Cf. Plin.‚ Hist. Nat„ V. vii. 7; “Contra Carthaginis
sinum duae AEgimuri Arae, scopuli verius quam insulae, inter Siciliam
maxime et Sardiniam.”—In the previous line these rocks have been
called saxa late⁷1lia,· but presently we read of immane dorsum mari
summo. We infer, therefore, that their bare summits were visible
above the ¹<urface of the water.

113—115. Unam. Understand navem, which is governed by serit in
the next line but one—cz vertice. The most generally received inter-
pretation of this expression is “from above.” The commentator-s
compare Georg. II. 310, AEn. V. 144, and Homer's κατ’ ἄκρης. But
some have translated a vertice in puppim, “from stem to stern.''—-
pontus, δεινῶς proflztctus. Just so we speak of shipping a “sea ” instead
of a wave.

116——1 23. illam refers to the ship of Orontes—rari, ‘¹ a few here aud
there.'’ This word is in strong antithesis to vasto. The few sailors
who could swim, dashed hither and thither by the violence of the
tempesta, thinly dotted the vast surface of the sea—tabum, “plankS.”
Compare Cicero, de Off. ΙΙΙ. 23; “Si tabulam de naufragio stultus
&immensus—hiems is from χειμών. It is here and frequently used in
