45. sunone secundd. One of the reasons why special mention is
made of Juno is contained in v. 59 ,·“ she presided over marriage. She
was, moreover, the tutelary deity of Carthage. In both capacities she
had shown her favour to Dido by being instrumental in introducing
AEneas to her acquaintance : this appears to be the thought likely to
spring up in Dido’s mind, on hearing her sister's emphatic mention ot*
the name of the goddess.

55. solvit pudorem. Thereby justifying the exclamation one would
be inclined to make on reading v. 24, sqq„ “ The lady doth protest too
much, methiuksff' ’

66. est is here not from esse, but from edere, “to eat.'' Observe the
1⁴elz.tionship between the Homer-ic ἔδμεναι, the Attio ἐσθίειν, the Latin
edere, the German essen, the English eat, &a

102. paribus auspiciis, “with equal powers.” The expression is
derived from the circumstance that, in war, it appertained to the
commander—in-chief alone to take the auspices. Hence the frequent
union of the words auspicium and imperizmz, which latter, in its
strictest sense, signifies “ military command.'’

121. (lum trepidant, &c.‚ “whilst the mounted hunters scour the
plain, and they enclose the lawns with a net,'’ &c. As the cavalry wings
of a legion were called aloe, so Virgil here applies the same term to the
inounted hunters who rode on either side of Dido and AEneas. Isidorus
is quoted by La Cei-da as distinguishing four classes of huntsmen,
vestigatores, indagatores alatores, pressores

138. cui pharetra. Understand erat.

143, 144. Apollo was represented as taking up his quarters, for the
purposes of consultation and of being worshipped, in winter at Patara,
a city of Lycia, situated on the river Xanthus, and in summer in the
island of Delos, his birth-place. His arrival in Delos was annually
wclcomed by crowds of worshippers from divers conum-ies, as, for
instance, by the Dryopes, a people of Doris near Mount Parnassus,
who claimed to be descendants of the god, and by the Agathyrsi, a
people of Sarmatia, who were accustomed to tattoo their persons
picti).
< 174. Fama. With this description of Fama, Cf. Ovid, Met. XII.
39—63‚ and Homer, Il. Δ 442—443. Compare also the humorous
description in Butler' s Hudibras.qk

ἕ There Is a tall, long-sided dame,
(But woudrons light), yclcped Fame,
That, like a thin ch 1111818011, boan ls
Herself on air, and e⁴1ts hei words:
[pon hei· shoulders wing she weaiqs
Like hanging slceves‚ lin d through with ears,
And eyes, and tongues, as poets list,
Made good by deep mythologist.
with those she through the welk-in flies,
And sometimes carries truth, oft lies.
