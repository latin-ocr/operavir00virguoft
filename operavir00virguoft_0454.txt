BOOK ΙΙ.

1. Conticuere. Do not neglect the force of con in this compound3
“ all with one accord held their peace.” There was a general cessation
of conversation the moment the asseinbled guests heard Queen Dido’s
command to zEneas to gratify her with a recital of his story. Tacere
signifies “ to hold one’s peace—not to speak;'' silere, “to be quiet—
not to make a 110156 of any kiud.” The same word occurs AEn. IX. 237,
and elsewhere—orsus is from ordiri.

3—13. renovare. The object of this verb is dolorem and the relative
clause qzcoeque (= et ea qnoe) ipsc, &cy—vidi. AEneas had been a speo-
tator of the events he is about to describe; and that was a circumstance
calculated to engaige the attention of his hearers. They would, how-
ever, feel their interest still more thoroughly awakened by his reminding
them that he had also been a prominent actor in the scene—talia
fando, “in speaking of such things.'¹ The Myrmidones and Dolopes
were peoples of Thessaly, who took part in the war against Troy, under
the command of Achilles and his son Pyrrhus, otherwise called Neop-
tolemus—nox coelo prcecz'p‘z'lat. Just as the sun is represented as rising
in the east and, with his chariot, travelling through the sky until he
sets in the west‚—so here the “damp night'' is described as having
more than half performed 1115 journey from west to east,—as having
passed the meridian and commenced 1115 descent. It is therefore past
midnight.—refzc9it‚ (perfect tense) is to be construed with the infinitivo
meminisse ; and lucta, “ with grief‚'' 15 the ablative of manner.

15, 16. Instar, &c., “build a horse, the likeness of a mountain [that
is ‘ like‚' or, ‘ as big as a niountain‚’—‘ of mountain-bnlk’] by the divine
art of Pallas.''-abiete 15 to be pronounced as a trisyllable, 50 as to form
a dactyl. The first vowel, α, 15 lengthened by position, as if the word
were written abjete.

17. 'cotum pro reditu simulavit, “they pretend that it is a votive
offering for their [safe] return’' back to Greece. The Greeks spread a
report, designed to beguile the Trojans, that they have erected this
horse as an offering to the gods, in order to secure their safe retreat to
their own country.

18. delecta viram corpora = delectos viros.

25. The construction is ‘nos rati sumus eos abiisse—Mycenas is put
for Greece in general. It was the seat of government of Agamemnon,
the generalissimo of the forces which beleagnered ’111-ογ.

26. solvit se laem = liberat se a luctu.

29. tendebat. Understand tentorium. [Compare the German “lagern.”]

31. donum Bli'ncrroe, “offering to Minerva.” This is the rendering of
Servius. Compare vv, 183, 184, below, where the horse is distinctly
declared by Sinon to be intended to appense Minerva for the violence
offered to the Palladium, which Ulysses and Diomedes bad stolen.
Some commentators, however, make Illincrrae the genitive case, and
