GEORGIC 1. 165

Before the wood is used for making a plough it is to be suspended
above the fire. The manner in which it withstands the action of the
smoke is a criterion of its adaptability to the purpose ; for unless it be
good and serviceable, the smoke will cause chinks and fissures in it.

176, 177. “’ Ι can recount to you many precepts handed down by the
ancients, if you do not refuse, and if you do not dislike, making an
acquaintance with minute concerns.'' With this apologetie introduction,
Virgil proceeds to enumerate some of these “praecepta’'

178. area, “the threshing-floor.'' For this was usually selected an
airy, open, and somewhat elevated part os the field. A spot where the
soil was clayey was considered the most eligible. This was soddened
with the lees of olive-oil, and the whole was then well worked. up and
levelled with rollers.

179. creta, strictly meaning “chalk‚” is here used in the sense of
aryilhc, “ clay.”

180, 181. The reason why so great compactness and solidity are
recommended is, that it is desirable that no weeds may spring up, and
that the fioor may not crack, “ for if it does (tum) '⁵ &a

184. bufo, “the toad.⁷' This word is not to be found elsewhere in
any classica] author.

187. contemplator item, ‘¹ observe also.”

193—196. “ Ι have seen many sowers steep the seed in the juice of
herbs [medicarezinficm-e,macerare alienis succis} and moisten them with
nitrum and with the black olive lees, before [that they sow them];
in order that there should be amore abundant produce in the deceptive
pods, and that they might be speedily cooked with a fire ever so low.'’
The object of the preparatory steeping of the seed was that the crop of
pulse might be greater, and that, when required for use, it might be
more easily cooked. It seems impossible to accept the explanation of
some, who say that the seecls themselves were boiled before sowing.

200. The historical infinitives ruere and refero-i serve here to denote—
not, as in most instances, a past action—but that which is customary
and common. Cf. Georgic IV. 134; AEneid IV. 422, and. VII. 15.

201—203. non aliter quam qui, “just like one who.'' The regular
construction of this passage would have been this: non aliter quam is
qui vix sumina virium contentione lembum remigiis subigit, simulac
brachia forte remiserit, retro refertur atque ab alveo in praeceps rapitur.”
In the text there is a transition from the form of the passive to that of
the active, and so illum is employed to indicate the original subject.
The words ·“ retro refertur ” are to be inferred from the line preceding
‘non aliter quam. Almus appears to refer to the current of the river;
but Wunderlich’s opinion that illum means the boat does not seem
worthy of adoption.

207. Pontus is very frequently used alone for Pontus Euxinus, “ the
Black Sea.’' See Greek Delectus, p. 84, note on xxxvi—fauces Abydi
means the straits of the Hellespont-

208. die is an old form of the genitive (and dative) for diei. WVagner
subscribes to the opinion that Virgil wrote diem, the accusative plural,
and that the final s was absorbed by the initia] 3 of the next word.
This line and the next allude to the autumna] equinox.

212. Cereale papaver. Ceres soothed her grief for the loss of her
abdueed daughter by eating seeds of poppy.
