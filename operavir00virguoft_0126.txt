116 NOTEs ON

In the fourth eclogae there is a great variety of instances.]—te72ui αυεηᾶ,
“011 the slender reed-pipe.” Cf. V. 10, “calamo agresti.” Arena meant,
originally, “oats;⁷' then “the stem of oats;’' and hence “the stem
used in making shepherds' pipeS.” There may have been a single pipe,
or a collection of reeds, as in the Pan's-pipe, or Pandean pipe. Com-
pare the Latin fistula, and Greek σῦριγξ.

3, malfam-is. Here the verb meditari may mean, “to think upon, as
in composing a new song‚'’ or “to practise, to play over.'' The latter
sense is not uncoinmon. So Cic. de Or. Ι. lxi. 260, (Demosthenes)
“ perfecit meditando, ut nemo planius eo locutus putaretur,’' and.
Demosthenes remedied his defective utterance, not by “ thinking? but
by “ practice.'’ According to these two meanings, we must translate,
“ you court the woodland muse,'’ or “you practise the woodland
song.’'

4, favimus, “we fly from, we fiy as exiles.” The Greek φεύγειν is
often used with reference to exiles. So ἠγγέλθη ὅτι φεύγοιεν οἴκοθεν ὑπὸ
τοῦ δήμου, Xon. Hell. I. i. 27.—chtzcs, “ easy, at your ease, comfort-
able.” The word seems originally to mean “ supple, limber, flexible‚”
and also “ tough, lasting :'' and hence “ slow, immoveableff' Cf. v. 25,
“lenta viburna,·'' Ecl. III. 38, “lenta vitis;⁷’ Georg. ΙΙ. 12, “lentae
genistae.'’

5. resonare Amaryllida, “to ring again with Amaryllis.‘' Resonare
is generally acconipanied with the ablative of the thing which causes
sound, as resonare ,ςέο-θρίω, plausit, &a Here we have the accusative of
the name re-echoed. Propertius (I. xviii. 31) even uses the nominative:
“resonant mihi Cynthia silvae-'’—Amaryll'ida is the Greek form of the
accusative.

6. 11(εο otia, “ this ease‚” zle. this repose and tranquillity. The plural
is used poetically for the singular. The god alluded to is Augustus
Caesar; and virgil represents his own fortunes by the happiness of
Tityrus. Note the emphatic use of “ille'' in the following lines:
“ille 1111111 semper deus ;⁷’ “illius a1·am,’' &c ; “ ille meas errare boves.”

8. imbuet, or inbuet, “shall imbues zze. shall soak or bedrench. So
imbuti sanquine (slaslii, “ swords dripping with blood :” sanquis ‘novus
‘imbuit arma, AEn. VII. 554.

10. quoe vellem, “whatever I like? The subjunctive mood gives au
indefinite character to the phrase. But the use of the tense affords
matter for thoughtg for as permisit may be translated ‘¹ he permitted,”
or “he has permitted,'’ “permisit ludere quae vellem'¹ ought to mean
“ he permitted me to play what Ι ἰίῘεεσῑ ,·” whereas “he has permitted
me to play what I like,'' should be “permisit ludere quae 1·ἕ]ἱ111.” Now
ὐἔῖἰῃῑ would not suit the nictre ; yet the sense requires ‘⁴' what I like?
and not “what Ι l‘t'lced!⁷ The student may explain this as he chooses3
but that present time is referred to may be conclusively inferred from
the words “ ut cernis.’'

12. usque adeo, “even to this point.”—usque means “all the way;'’
usque α mari, “ all the way from the soa ;” usque Romam, “all the way
to R01ne;” usque ad cum finem, “ all the way to that end 3⁸³ and so on ⁷
in point of time, usquc α Romulo and usque acl Romulum. Adeo is
properly ced-co, “to that,” and means “to such a degree, to such a

pitch.” The original form may have been ced-eom, or perhaps acl-eod,-
for eod was the old form os icc.
