THE BUGOLICS.—ECLOGUE 1. 117

turbatur, “ clisturbance is going on,” referring to the confusion caused
by the recent civil ware. Cf. v. 71—73. Horace constantly refers to
the same subject. Both Virgil and Horace regarded Augustus as the
saviour of his country. Note the use of the passive impersonal tur-
batum· and cf. J uv. ΙΙΙ. 200, (pudibus trepidatur ab imis, “‘aU is hui-ry
and confusion at the bottom of the stairs.”

13. protenus, “forward, straight on;⁷' here used with reference to
space, but more commonly applied to time in the sense of “ forthwiffl,
immediately.’'

14. ⁸camellos, spem ⁴qreyis . . . reliquit, “she left twins, the hope of the
fiockss’ Boys are often puzzled by this passage, because of the inter-
jection ali Ι which seems to break the connexion of the sentence. The
accusative {somello-3 is governed by reliquit, and spem ,(χνοςχίδ· 15 put in
apposition with yemellos. It is common to find a noun of multitude
placed in apposition with a substantive in the plural. So v. 75, ‘⁴ Ite
meae, felix quondam pecus, ite capellae ;'⁷ and Georg. IV. 167, “ ignavum
fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent?

15. connixa, “having yeaned with many throes‚·” literally, having
struggled hard.

16. laeva, “left-handed,'' i. e. awkward, foolish. So Hor. A. P. 301,
O 690 laevus, qui purgor bilem sab verni temporis Ῑιωιαιη, “ Oh! what a
foul Ι am to take medicine for the bile in spring.'’

17. dc coelo tactas, “smitten from heaven‚'' asse. by lightning. The
ancients thought that disasters caused by lightning were marks of the
divine displeasure. Cf. Liv. XXV. 7, “ Tempestates foedae fuere : tacta
dc coelo 11111101.υ Id. XXIX. 14, ‘⁴ duos soles visos, et nocte inte-fluxisse,
. . . et multis locis murum de coelo tactum.⁷' Aristophanes <Clouds‚
v. 400) ridicules this 110131011, and says that Jupiter sometimes strikes
1115 own temples and the oak-trees: but yet the oaks could never have
offended him, · alze ,χ could not have foi-swern themselves. ·

ἀλλὰ τὸν αὑτοῦ ’γε νεὼν βάλλει, καὶ Σούνιον ἄκρον Ἀθηνῶν,
καὶ τὰς δρῦς τὰς μεγάλας· τί παθών; οὐ γὰρ δη δρυς ἐτιορκεῗ.

18. πμεερθ &c This verse is rejected by the editors as not being
found 111 the oldest manuscripts. Cf. Ecl. ix 14, aud Pl int Asin. II. i.
14, picus, comae est ab ἰιευᾶ· σοι-τωο ,Ρ-ἀικα ab (cemani, “the wood-
pecker and the crow are on the lef3t t'he raven and the owl upon the
right.''

19. iste deus qui sic, “who that god of yonis is.'’ The subjunctive
mood 11010 marks au iudirect question. The direct question would be,
“ Iste deus quis estZ’'—‘t'3te is a demonstrative pronoun pointing to a
person addressed : “that of yours‚'' ‘¹ that near you.’' The old grammar
rule is worth reinembering : ιἸιίσ qui apud me est, iste qui apud te est,
ille qui apud illum est.” Refer to Young's Latin Delectus, p. 93.

22. quo . . . depellere, “whither we are accustomed to drive down
our tender lambs. ‘'’

24. now am “1 knew? contracted for ‘izozei-‚am Novi, originally
