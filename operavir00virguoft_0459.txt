441. testudine. Cf. Liv. XXXIV. 39; “Sublatis deinde supra capita
scutis, continuatisque ita inter se ut non modo ad caecos ictus sed ne ad
inferendum quidem ex propinquo telum loci quidquam esset, testu-
dine facta subibant.'' The covering of shields thus dovetailed into one
another, or “ locked'' together, was called. tescudff‘ from the resem-
blance it bore to the back of a tortoise.

453. [Amen erat, &cx In order to get to the roof (v. 458) AEneas
made use of a door, which was known to him but secret to others, at
the back of the pulace. This door led out upon a corridor, from which
one could go into all the apartments. This private entrance was made
use of by Andromache when she paid a family visit, unaccompauied by
any retinue‚ to Priam and Hecuba.

463. qua samma, &c., “ where the topmost story made the joints easy
to give way.”-—labames z faciles ad resolutionem.

471--475, mala oramina pascus (from pasci), “which has fed on
noxious herbs.'' Cf. ll. X. 94: βεΒρωκὼς κακὰ φάρμακα.-ὂνα7ηα was,
originally, a contraction for brea-ima, sc. (lies,· hence it came to mean
the winter solstice‚ and, finally, was frequently used to eignify the
winter generally.— linquis trisulcis, “ a three-forked tongue,” which,
however, he darts to and fro so rapidly as to make it appear that he has
several tongues in play. Cf. Ovid. Met. III. 343 “tresque vibrant
linguae.’' These verses are nearly the rame as Geor. ΙΙΙ. 437, sqq.

483. ec inqentem . . . fenestram, “and made a. great breach‚ with a
spacious mouth.'' [The Latin fenestra is the Frcnch “fenetl'e,'’ and the
German “ Fenster.”]

491. vi patria, ⁴‘ with his hereditary impetuosity,’' with a violence as
great as that of his father Achilles.

492. ariete is here a trisyllable (qu. aojete). We may translate ariete
crebro, ‘⁶ with repeated concussion.'' We are not to understand that an
aries or batteringvram was actually in use,· but the expression is
chosen merely to indicate an operation similar to that performed by the
aries. [creber. See note Cornelius Nepos, p. 90.]

526. Pyrrhus, otherwise called Neoptolemus (as in verse 549), was
son of Achilles and De'ida11]ia, the daughter of King Lycomedes.—
infesto vulnere, “with the hostile wound‚'’ which he intends to inflict
upon Polites.

540. quo te salum mentiris, “ from whom you lyingly declare yourself
descended.''

558. sinc ‘nomine corpus, “ a nameless—an indistinguishable—corpse.’'

567—588. These verses are wanting in xnost manuscripts. It is pro-
bable that they proceedcd from Virgil‘s pen, but were expunged by
Varius or Tucca. Compare the first note on Book L-super unus eram
= unus supereram. The same romeis occurs Ecl. Vl. 6. AEneas
abandons his position on the roof, and, on his way to his residmwe, he
takes leave of all the fond familiar objects he meets with. At the altar
of the temple of Vesta in the citadel he bcholds Helen, sitting as a sup-
pliant sor the protection of the goddess; and the sight of her banishes
