curetes, οι· priests of Cybele, when they were beatiug their drums to
stifle the eries of the infant Jupiter; whence the god blessed the bees
and regarded them with favour. Vugil adds, that they fed him in the
Dictaean or Cretan Cave.

153. solae, “they alone.'' This word is emphatic, as we see by its
position here, and its repetition v. 155.

158. alioe . . . pars . . . aliae, “some others . .. others:” the
phrases aliz· . . . alii, pars . . . par-3, are often intermingled.

167. aut aymimz facco, δια, “ or in close array they drive forth from
the hive that idle brood, the drones.”

170. The industry of the bees is compared with the labour of the
Cyclopean blacksmiths in Vulcan’s forge under Mount AEtna.

174. This line, in which there are five spondees, has often been
quoted as an instance of the effect produced by spondees in a Hex-
ameter line: the poet wishes to describe the labour and heaviness of
the work.

175. in numerum. Cf. Ecl. VI. 27.

177. Cecropias apes, “ the Attio bees.’' The bees of Mount Hymettus,
near the city of Cecrops, yielded excellent honey.

220. divinoe mentis. Ladewig translates this “ des Weltgeistes,⁹' i. e.,
“ the World-Ghost‚'' “ the sou} οι· spirit of the world.” The ancients
had a notion that the world was not a dea-d mass, but a living being,
which was endowed with a seul, and this soul, as some thought, was
no other than God himself.

251. si veo-0, &a Virgil now discusses the diseases to which bees are
liable, and the various cures for the same : this leads him to notice the
legend of Aristaeus. who fell in love with Eurydice, the wife of tho
poet and singer Orpheus. As Eurydice was flying from her admirer, a
serpent stung her and she died, in punishment for which injury, the
gods destroyed the bees of Aristaeus, who went to consult the sea-god
Proteus, as to the best method of remedying the disaster. Proteus
advised him to sacrifice a certain number of bulls and heifers; and
when he had done so, swarms of bees sprang up from their cai-casos.
The legend of Aristaeus, with the fable of Orpheus and Eurydice, closes
the book.
