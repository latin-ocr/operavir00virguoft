GEORGIC 11. 173

field,—-both sets cut diagonally‚ and sharp-pointed sets; whilst other
trees expect the down-pressed arches of a layer, and [to see] a nursery
fiourishing in their own soil.'' Here are three modes of artificial
propagation mentioned ε (1) by means of suckers plucked off from the
parent tree and planted in furr0ws; (2) by means of cuttingS,—sets cut
from the parent plant, and then either cut across the lower end—the
end to be inserted into the ground—by two diagonals intersecting one
another, or else sharpened to a point at that end ; and (3) by means of
layers, not severed from the parent trunk, but having their upper
extremities bent down into the soil, and so forming a nursery of young
plants growing around the tree or plant to which they belong. The
adjective tenero, though agreeing with corpore, would seem to belong
more appropriately to plantas,· and indeed one Manuscript reads
“plantas teneras abscindens de corpore matrum.'’ [But would there
be anything outrageous in the suggestion that as mater is here figura-
tively applied to a tree, so the adjective tener may be used in a
figurative sense likewise 2]

33, 34. The poet here speaks of apples being grafted upon a pear-
stock; in other words, of the pear-tree bearing the engrafted apples.
But whether he means that the cornel was grafted on the plum, or the
plum on the cornel is not quite so clear. The natural translation
appears to be “ and the stony cornels [i.e., the fruit] to redden on the
plum-trees.'' But others render “ and the stony cornels [i.e., the trees]
to bloom with plums.'' Now pranis may undoubtedly come either
from prunus, “ a plum-tree,” or from primum, “a plum ;” and it may
also be conceded to those who urge the latter interpretation, that
Virgil may have used‘corna‚ the fruit, instead of coruos, the trees, just
as in v. 426 he has poma for pomi. But the two following objections
to the second mode of translating, appear to leave no alternative but
the retention of the first. These are (1) that “stony” is an epithet,
not of trees but of fruits 3 (2) that, the cornel being itself redder than
the plum, the tree producing naturally the former, could not be said
“ to grew red” from the substitution by engrafting of the latter.

Taburnus, a mountain in Samnium, distinguished for the abundance of
its olives.

luminis oras, “into the confines of light.''

64. Paphiae. The myrtle was sacred to Venus, who was particularly
worshipped at Paphos, in the island Cyprus. Compare Horace, Ode Ι.

a chaplet of its leaves when he went down to Erebus, whose shaden
imparted to the under part of the foliage the dax-k tinge which distin-
guishes it from the bright upper surface.
