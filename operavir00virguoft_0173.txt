GEORGIC 1. 163

146. improbus. Observe the emphatic position of this word at the
beginning of a line : “ irksome as it is.’'

147. mortalesds equivalent to the prose homines. Sallust, who is
addicted to the use of poetical forms of expression 111 1115 prose
compositions, frequently uses mortales for hominm—ferro vertere teo-ram
has the same meaning as “terram vertere ’⁹ at the beginning of this
Georgic.

148, 149. Τ110 construction appears to be, as Heyne suggests,
“quum jam sylvae (quie poetice diis) sacrae (dicuntur), deficerent
(quoad) glandes et arbuta.⁷’ But some commentators regard mandes
and arbuta as nominatives to deficerent and as governing sacrm salue in
the genitive case. ‘Forestsss’ says La‹1exvig,“are sacred, because ev ely
tiee has its Dryad [Hamadryad 3].y ’—D0dona is put by metonymy for
quer σω, 011 account of its far· famed sacred oak- grove, in which was
situated the oracle of Jupiter.

151. esset is from edm e. Compare Latin Delectus, p. 6.

160. sint, the subjunctive, as being in a dependent question—arma.
= instrumenta, “ implements ;” as in AEneid Ι. 177, and elsewhere.

161. Queis sine. This is an instance of anastrophe, or the placing
after the word it governs a preposition which would regularly precede
it. Compare AEneid Ι. 348, “Quos inter medius venit furor;'’ Cor-
nelius Nepos, Conon, 2, ‘⁵ Hanc adversas Pharnabazus ; '’ Culex, v. 3.
“Izoec propter;” &c. This figure is seldom employed except when the
governed word is a1‘›1·01ioun.—s*e³”c' is from siv-ere (sero, sevi, satum),
“to sow, to plant.’' Distinguish from this the verb &Era-e (sero, serui,
sertum), “to sew together, to eonnect;” and the adjective serus, “late”

163. Eleusinae matris = Cereris. The adjective Eleu-sinus is for
Memmius, which last form is more completely identical with the
Greek epithet Ἐλευσίνιος. Ceres derived this title from the circum-
stance of her being particularly worshipped at Eleusis in Attica. The
term “mater’' is frequently applied to goddesses, as “pater'‘ is to
gods; when used without any qualifying adjective or appositimi, they
generally refer to Cybele and Jupiter respectively. The former is
sometimes styled “ magna mater‚'’ as being the mother of all the gods.

165. Celei. Ceres had insti-ucted Celeus, the father of Triptolemus,
in the art of making various agricultural implements and convenienees
out of osiers.

166. mystica vannus Iacchi. From vannus 15 derived its English
equivalent, “fanj’ Its form was probably that of a large basket
or sieve3 in this the corn was shaken about, and the grain separated
from the chaff. It was called mystica on account of its being used in
the mysteries of Bacchus. who is called Iacchus here and in Eclogue
VI. 15. This name—which was seldom made use of except on solemn
and sacred occasions—is derived from ἰαχεῖν, and owes its origin to the
shouts which the Bacchanal-s indulged in at the festivals of their deity.

168. divinus appears to be here used in the sense of praeclaras,
“noble'' So the Greek δῖος, θεῖος.

169-175. Virgil describes the process of constructing a plough;
and he certainly begins at the beginning, for he introduces us to the
yet tender sapling which. when more advauced in growth, is to form
the beam or body (baris) of the instrument. The process is to seck out
a young elm and at once to bend it into the shupe of a buz-is .· it will
