THE nummos—nemeen 11. 127

54. proxima, “placed near’' (to the laurel). This must- be the
meaning of p1·0.1'2'7na,as we see from sic posilae in the following line.
The laurel (or hay-leaf) was often joined with the myrtle-leaf. Cf.
Hor. Od. ΠΙ. iv. 19 z

. . . ul: premerer saera
Lam-oque collataque myrto,
Non sine dis animosus infans.

The two are mentioned together in Ecl. VII. 62 :

Formosae myrtus Veneri. sua laurea Phoebo.

56. rusticus es, “you are a boor, Corydon.’' Cf. Theocr. XX. 3,
βώκολος ὢν ἐθέλεις με κύσαι τάλαν;

57. ozee si certes . . . concedat, “nor, if you were to contend . . .
would Iollas give him up.'' We have the present subjunctive followed
by the present subjunctive, as in Eel. IV. 58, “ Pan mecum si certet . . .
dicat se victum.” Some MSS. read concedet ,· and if that be the reading,
we might expect si certas, “ nor, if you contend . . . will Iollas give him
up.'' Iollas was the master of Alexis.

58. floribus Austrum . . . immisi, “ I have leb loose the sirocco upon
the flowers;” a proverbial expression for “causing damage.’'-—Auster
is the dry hot wind called siv-occo by the Italians.

61. Pallas . . . ipsa colat, ‘⁴ let Pallas dxvell herself in the citadels
which she has founded.’' Pallas is often mentioned as the tutelary
goddess of csties, as of Troy, Athens, &c. : hence she is called πολιάς,
πολιοῦχος. Τ116 very fa'ce of Troy depended upon the possession of her

statue, called the Palladium.
63. torva leoemt, &c. Cf. Theocr. Idyll. X. 30:

‘A αἲξ τὸν κύτισον, ὁ λύκος τὰν αἶγα διώκει,
‘A ’γέρανος τῶροτρον· ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπὶ τὶν μεμάνημαι.

64. cytis-zm. This is the Greek κύτισος. It seems ‘co mean a kind of
clover. The word occurs in Ecl. I. 78, ‘⁸ florentem cytisum.’'

65. sua quemque, “ his own pleasure draws each man‚'' i. e. every one
is led by his own peculiar pleasures,—every man has his haste. The
Latius are fond of joining suus with quisque. So, in the common pro-
verb, Suum cuique, “ let every one have his due;’' and AEn. VI. 743,
“ quisque suos patimur Manes?

66. aratra jusso suspensa. WVhen the plough was brought home from
the field, the ploughshare was turned up, in order that the framewotk
of the plough might drag along the mad, like a sledge. In France,
where the lands are greatly subdivstled, ploughs are brought home in
this manner, from a distance of two or three miles. Cf. Hor. Epod.

Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves

Collo trahentes languido.

67. duplicat umbrae. Cf. Ecl. I. 84.

70. semiputata, “ half-cut, l1alf-(lressed.” Corydon was a vine-dresser
(frondator or vindemiator), and while musing upon love, he had been
neglecting his work. Now the thought of time wasted comes rushing
upon him—in ulmo. Vines were trained, or, as the poets say, weddod
