shade. Virgil speaks with great delight of lounging 01· sleeping beneath
the shade of trees, as a protection from the summer's heat. Cf.

Ecl. V. 70:
Ante focum si frigus erit, si messis in umbra.

Audin Georg. II. 470, he mentions this pleasure among the denghte
of a country life 2—-

Compare also Ecl. ΙΙ. 8:

54, Hinc tibi . . . susurro. These three verses have given great
trouble to the commentators. They dislike qzcce semper, which, they
say, is bald and without force. Burmann proposed quse sarvie, or qztae
serpit. Many other changes and conjectures have been offered; but
they have not improved the lines. Wagner takes them as they are,
and after arguing that we should join lcz'nc with vicino ab limite, he
gives the following version :—“ Hinc a vicino limite, sepes, quae semper
Hyblaeis apibus florem salicti depasta (est), saepe tibi levi (apum)
susurro suadebit somnum inires ‘⁶ Here, from your neighbour’s
boundary, the hedge, which always by Hyblaean bees has its willow
flowers fed upon, will often by the gentle hum (of those bees) induce
you to go to sleep.'⁷ But we may remark, that vicino ab limite need
not mean “from‚’' but “on’' or “at'’ This is a common meaning of
ab. So, often in Caesar, as Bell. Gall. IV. 17, ab extremui parte, “at the
end ;” V. 32, α millibus passuum circiter duobus, “ about two miles off,”
i. e. at a distance of about two miles. So afronte, ‘⁶ in front ;'’ a teryo,
“at the 1·ear‚” διο. Further, it is very common in Latin to place a
correlative noun (the so<called antecedent) after the relative pronoun3
as Caes. Bell. Gall. V. 37, “Sabinus quos tribunos militum habebat, se
sequi jubet;’¹ and thus, here, qzcae sepes is “the hedge which.'' If
so, qzcae vicino ab limite sepes must mean, “ the hedge upon your neigh-
bour's boundary, which,” &a It is questionable whether lVagner has
any right to alter the words in translating. Hinc may mean, “from
this side‚’' or “on this side.'’ Cf. Liv. Ι. xiii. 2.—florem depasta is,
literally, ‘¹ fed upon or devoured of its flowers,'’ i. e. having its flowers
fed upon. Depctscere is, “to seed upon, to eat up.’' So Columella,
“ si haedi roscidas herbas depaverint ;'' aud Georg. IV. 539, “ qui tibi
nunc viridis depascunt summa. Lyczei:'' and the accusative with the
passive verb is not uncommon, particularly in the poets3 as Horace,
stratus membra, “having his limbs stretched;'’ and in Virgil even with
an adjective, os humerosque deo similis, “in face and shoulders like
a gods—WVe may translate the whole passage thus: “And here the
hedge on your neighbour's boundmy, which always has its willow
fiowers fed upon by Hyblaean bees, will with gentle hum invite you
to go to sleep.''—-salictum is, properly, “a willow thicket.'’ Compare
