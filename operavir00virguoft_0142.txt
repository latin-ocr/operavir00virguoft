. eorg. . .

78. me discedere flevit, “she wept at my departure:” flere is often
used with an accusative of the object bewailed, and sometimes with an
objective clause, as Prop. I. vii. 18, “agmina septem flebis in aeterno
surda jacere situ.'’

79. longum vale, “ a long farewell.” So we find supremum vale, “ the
last farewell.” Compare Shakespea1·e,Heu. VIII. act iii. sc. 2, “Fare-

well, a long farewell, to all my g1·eatness.''———v17l5, τᾶῖέ ; the last syllable “

is made short before the initial vowel of inquit; this is aramty in Latin
versification‚ but very common in Greek hexameters.

82. depulsis, “ weaned ; ’' literaliy “ driven away‚'’ i. e., from the
breast. We have the full expression in Ecl. VII. 15, “depulsos a lacte
agnos ; ” and in Georg. III. 187, ‘⁶ depulsus ab ubere matris.”

83. foeto pecori. See note on Ecl. Ι. 50.

84. Pollio. The literary taste of Pollio is praised by Horace, Od. ΙΙ.
i. 11, “ grande munus Cecropio repetes cothurno,” &cz

85. lectori vestro, i. e., Pollioni.

86. nova carmina. Here nova may be understood to mean “not

id. Od. III. i. 2, ‘⁴ carmina non prius audita cauto.’'

87. jam cornu petat. See note on v. 64, ‘⁶ malo me petit.”

90. Bavium, διο. Bavius and Maevius were two poets detested by
Vix-gil and Horace. “ Nam Maevius et Bavius pessimi fuerunt poetae,
inimici tam Horatio quam Virgilio.'’ Servius.

91. jungat vulpes, διο, The verb junyffl'e here means “to yoke for
draught, or for the plough.'’ The expression mulyeat hircos is likewise
a satire upon useless labour. So Lucian, when ridiculing two long-
winded philosophers‚ asks, if it does not seem that the one is milking a
he-goat (οὐ δοκεῖ τράγον ἀμέλγειν), and that the other is trying to catch
the milk in a sieve?

92. humi nascentia, “which grow upon the ground ; '’ i. e., ground-
growing : a Greek would have made a compound word of this, as
χθονοτρεφής, AEsch. Agam. 1407. We may note the distinction between
the ·‘ ground-strawberry‚” and the fruit of the strawberry-tree—fraya
is neuter plural.

93. friyidus anquis. Cf. Ecl. VIII. 71.

95. non bene creditur, “you cannot vxell trust ; ” i. e., it is not well

“but they get trusted.’'

96. reice. This word must be read as a dissyllable. It is sometimes
stated to be a contraetion from refice, but it may be explained as re-ice .·
the verb Ξσέτὲ being an old form of jarem, often used by Plautus;
whence the passive participle ictus. the substantive ictus. Compare am—
i'cio, and ‹zm-ictus.

98. silae praeceperit oestus, “if the heat shall have got the start of
the milk‚'' i. e., shall have previously dried it up.

100. in ervo, “ among the vetchesl’ The ervum was our ⁸‘ bitter

πύῤῥιχος.
