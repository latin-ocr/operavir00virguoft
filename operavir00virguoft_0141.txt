new speaker appears, Palaemon, who is at once called upon to hear and
decide.

52. quin aye .ςὶ quid Ῐιαόεε, “ corne on then, ifyou have anything,'' i. (3.,
if you have anything worth hearing. Cf. Ecl. IX. 32, “incipe, si

uid habes.”
q 56. et mmo omnis aqer, &a He refers to the spring-time: so Bion, vi.
17, εἴαρι πάντα κύει, παντ’ εἴαρος ἁδέα βλαστεΐ. See also the beautiful
description of spring, Georg. ii. 323, &c.

59. alternis, “in alternate verses,” This system of alternative or

62. Phoebo . . . lauri. Cf. Ecl. VII. 62, “sna laurea Phoeb0.‘'

63. sume rubens : this is, in effect, a compound word. Compare suave-
οῑεηε, and the note on Ecl. II. 48, ‘· bene olentis anethi.'’

64. malo me petit, “attacks me with apples,” i. e.. throws apples at

taken absolutely, or we may supply nidum ; “ have built their nest.‘’ ⁷

71. altera. If this word be strictly interpreted, it must mean, “a
second ten :'’ see notes on VV. 34, 40: it is very rarely, if ever, that
the Latius use alter for alius: still we may remark that in the parallel
passage Theocritus uses ἄλλα, “ others;'' δέκα μᾶλα φέρω . . . καὶ αὔριον
ἄλλα τοι οἷσῶ, ΙΙΙ. 10.
