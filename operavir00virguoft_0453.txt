crisis‚—to that upon which an evenb depende, or, as we sometimes say,
hin res.

ὅὲῗδ. mea. ‘maa-ima cura. For the reason why Venus so styles Asea-
nius, see AEn. IV. 275.—80p1'tum sonmo, “lulled in sleep.” Cf. Soph.

Cf. Cic. de Nat. Deorum; “Est enim omne quo vescuntur homines
penus.'¹ This word is found ot' the second, third, and fourth declen-
sions, and of all three genders. As a neuter of the third dcclensiou ic
is penus, penb'm's.—flummis adolere Penates. The female servants had
also the office of keeping up the fire on the hearth in honour of the
Penates. Silius Italicus thus imitates Virgil’s description :

. . non una ministri
Turba gregis 3 posuisse dapes his addita cura,
His adolere focos, his ordine pocula ferre;
Necnon et cenis struitur penus.

There was a strict observance of etiquetize at the court of Dido : first

Hence it was pout-ed into the pocula of the goes-ts. The crater was
usually wreathed with a garland, whence the expression vina coronare.

such word as implere.

736, 737. in mensam . . . honorem, “she spilled upon the table the
offex-ing of wine‚’' the libation.—Libato‚ nith ‘mero understood, is abla-
tive absolute.

740. crinitus. The citharoeds wore their hair long, like their patron
god, Apollo. Compare AEn. IX. 638. Ovid says of Arion

* Der Yungling biillt die schonen Glieder
In Gold und purpur wunderbar.

Um Hals und Stil-n und Wangeu
Fliegt dustend das bekrfinzte Ham. Semnan.
