ECLOGUE X.—GALLUS.

ARGUMEN'r.—— Vhilst Cornelius Gallus, the famous soldier and poet,
was absent from Rome—probably with the object of defending the
coasts of Italy against Sextus Pompeius—his favourite Lycoris, whose
praises he had so often celebrated in song, became untrue to him, aud
accompanied her new paramour, Marc Antony, in his expedition under
Agrippa to Gaul. In his grief, Gallus had begged of Virgil to compose
a pastoral poem, which might, perhaps, have the effect of calling the
faithless fair one back to her first lover's arms. This circumstance
suggests to Virgil the fiction that Gallus has betaken himself, in the
guise of a shepherd, to the mountains and glens of Arcadia. The
poem is in imitation of the first Idyll of Theocritus.

1. Arethusa: a nymph of whom the river god Alpheus became
enamoured. He pursued her under the sea (here, V. 5, called Doris,
after the mother of the Nereids,just as iu Ecl. IV. 32 it is termed
Thetis). Arethusa eventually reappeared at the surface of the earth
as a fountain in the island of Ortygia, near Syracuse, in Sicily3 and,
like many other nymphs‚ was regarded by tho shepherds as an inspiring
goddess.

2. sed quoe . . . Lycoris, “ but for Lycoris herself to read,’' that she
may blush for her faithlessness aud repent her desertion of so true
and constant a lover.

5. Doris amara, &c. The idea intended to be conveyed is, “so may
you, Arethusa, preserve your waters pure, unmixed with the brine of
the sea.'’

12. Aonie. Aonia was an earlier name of Boeotia, in which was the
fountain Aganippe at the foot of Mount Helicon. The Muses are
sometimes called Aganippides.

21. unde amoq· istc = “quam puellam amaS.''

24. ayresti . . . honore, The chaplet of flowers which Sylvanus
was accustomed to wear.

31. tamen, “ at least ’¹ my love shall form a theme of song among
you aster niy death.

“But you, Arcadian swains, shall sing my grief ;
And on your hills my last complaints renew :
So sad a song is only worthy you.⁷’-—Dryden.

⁴28. furor, “ frenzy :'’ a poetical name for any violent love or passion.

52. certum cst, “l am dehrmincd, my mind is made up.''
