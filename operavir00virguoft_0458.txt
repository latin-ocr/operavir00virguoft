The³ fatal day, 111Υ appointed hoiir has come,

When wrathful Jove⁷s irrevocable doom

Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.

The fire consumes the town, the foe commands:

And arlned hosts, an nnex1)ected force,

Break from the howels of the fatal horsel'

Trapp’s rendering is as follows 2-—

XVhen grenning he replied : Our last of days,
And Troy's incvitzible honr is come ;
We Trojans have been, Ilium once has been,
And the long glory of the Dardan ruce z
To Argos cruel Jove lias all transferr’d,
And Greece now domineers in flaming Troy.
The lofty steed amidst the city pours
Arm’d troops; and Sinon 001111101- scatters fire,
Insulting: others through the open’d gates
Arrive by thousands,-a more num'rous force
Thau ever yet from great Mycenae 0111110.”
