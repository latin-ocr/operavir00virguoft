GEORGIC 1. 157

adjective (equus, Its most common application is to that greatest
expanse in nature, the water-y plain, the sea—ferro scindere = arare.

52. patrios . . . locurum. There does not appear to be any necessity
for treating pali-ios cullas locorum as an instance of hypallage for cultus
patriorum locorum. On the contrary, such a course would seem to be
forbidden by the previous occurrence of the word “ ignotum.’' The
soil of a hereditary estate could hardly be said to be strange and
unknown to the heir upon whom it devolved. It appears rather
that the poet, investing the subjects of which he treats with the attri-
bute of vitality, has ascribed even to the inanimate soil the possession
of a pedigree aud a lineage; and therefore warns the purchaser‚ before
rashly determining the appropriation of his land, to ascertain its prior
condition and disposition, and the mode os cultivation to which its
ancestors —that is, itself in former times—had been subjected. [Com-
pare the note of Ladewig, who supports an opinion similar to the
above, with that of Wagner, who maintains that patrios belongs to loco-
rum. The employment of such a verb as recuset in line 53 may per-
haps be adduced as confirmatory of the explanation given above]

54—59. ‘⁶ Here crops of corn, there grapes, come with greater suc-
cess ,· 111 another place tree-f1·uits and the spontaneous grass fiourish.
See you not how Tmolus sends forth his saffron odours, India its ivory,
the languid Sabaeans their own peculial· frankincense, whilst the
stripped Chalybes produce iron, and Pontus its foetid castoreum, and
Epirus its palm-bearing Elian mares?

56, 57. ‘nonne vides—an expression common in Lucretius—lende
expression and variety to the style. Tmolus, a mountain of Lydia (at
the foot of which lay the capital Sardis), was celebrated for its odorife-
rous saffron.— India mittit ebur, namely, from the elephants with which
it abounds.—molles Sabaei. The Sabaei, a people of Arabia Felix,
were, like all the oriental nations, considered by the Romans to be
effeminate and luxurious. From this opinion it is probable that few of
us moderns would be inclined to dissent, however much we might
hesitate to accord a much higher character for energy and hardihood
to the Italians themselves as we now know them. These Sabaei were
the same as the people of the scriptura] “ Sheba.'’

58, 59. Chalybes, A people dwelling on the south-east coast of the
Black Sea, bordei-ing on Armenia. Their country produced iron of
the best quality. They are styled wudz· as being smiths. Nudas in
Latin, and ’γυμνός 111 Greek, are often employed, not in the strict sense
of “ naked,’⁷ but merely to denote absence of some portion of the
usual articles of attire or equipment. For instance, they are applied to a
soldier without his helmet, or without his shield, as has been noted at
p. 85 of the Greek Deiectus, and at p. 171 (note on Ι. 25) of Caesar's
Gallie wan—Pontus, the most easterly of the four northern divisions
of Asia Minor, produced a species of beavcr (κάστωρ), from a certain
gland in which was extracted a strong-smelling niedicinal fluid called
castoreum. Epir-w, called by the Greeks εὔιππος, εὔπωλος, was cele-
brated for its breed of swift horses. In Eliadum palmas equarum there
seems to be a decided instance of hypallage, for equaS, palmas Eliadwn
(certaminum) ferentes.

60—70. “ Nature imposed these laws and everlasting conditions upon
fixed locahties, at once, at the very time when Deucalion cast the
