THE nimium—BOOK 11. 257

as it was built in eonformity with the expressed will of Minerva, it may
be called a present of οι· from, Minerva—innupla This epithet is
applied to the goddess from her perpetual virginity. Hence also, most
probably, her name of Pallas, froin the Greek πάλλαξ. Some derive
this appellnti0n‚ however, from πάλλειν, on account of the spear which
the goddess. braudidml iu her hand; and others say that it owes its
origin to the name of the giant Pallas, whom Minerva slew.

It had been foretold to Priami that on a certain day a child should be
born, on whose account Troy was sated to be destroyed. On the day
mentioned Paris was born to Priam, and Munippus to Thymoetes;
wherenpon Pi iam caused Munippus and his mother to be put to death.
There was, therefore, some ground for supposing that the recommenda-
tion of Tnymoctes was dictated by revenge.

adopted a different interpretation ; he translates,-

And what to credit from a captive foe.

81—85. Palamedes was son of Nauplius, king of Euboea, a descendant
of the Egyptian Belus. It was he who exposed the trick of Ulys=es’
feigned insanity, and so compelled him to a participation in the Trojan
war. Ulysses‚ enraged at this proceeding, and jealous of the great
reputation enjoyed by Palamedes, contrived to excite against the latter
a suspicion of treachery, in consequence of which he was stoned to
death by the army.-—Observe the alliteration in “insontem infando
iudicio.’' So we have “lumine lugent” in v. 85. The accusation
against Palamedes was originally founded on the discovery of a letter,
forged by Ulysses. This letter—purporting to come from Priam to
Palamedes—urged upon the latter the speedy fulfilment of a compact
by which he had engaged to deliver the Grecian army into Priam’s
hand in consideration of a sum of money which had been already paid.
Meantime Ulysses had caused a bole to be dug secl-etly under the tent
of his victim, and a quantity of treasure to be hidden there. This,
when discovered, was deemed to be conclusive evidence of the guilt of
Palamedes, and he met with the fate mentioned above.—quia bella
vetabat, “because he was opposed to the war.'' This is the ground
Sinon assigns as the real one for the execution 3 it was one calculated
