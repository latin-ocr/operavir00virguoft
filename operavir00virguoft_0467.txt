xxv. 33 “ Amat janua limen.''

199. subtrahitur sollum, the “sea flies from beneath—is withdrawn
from,———the1n.’' The word solum does not always signify “the ground,”
but is put for whatever lies under, and furnishes a support to some-
thing else; and so the sea. is, with respect to shipS, the &lang—the
subjectum or szcbsto·atec7n‚—the air is the solam with respect to birds,

distinguish matus (feminine), “an apple-tree‚’' malum (in Greek μῆλον),

yard-arms.’'
