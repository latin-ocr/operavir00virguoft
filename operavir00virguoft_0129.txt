under.” Samiam tert-castores, Lucr. Ι. 8, “the earth puts forth fiowers.”
Hence, in this passage, we may understand sumitate, ‘⁶ raise, breed
your oxen.'' Cf. Georg. III. 73, “quos in spem statues submittere
entiS.”

g 47. er90 twa rura manebant, “therefore your lands will rem-ain
yours.” Er9o is “on this account, accordingly, ,onsequently,'’ i.e. in
consequence of the favour and protection of your patrea—Wagner
says that ίιια is emphatic, and that a stress must be laid upon that
word rather than upon manebant, implying that no veteran soldiers
will have a right to come and say, “Depairt! these lands are not
years, but mine :'’ and he compares Ecl. IX. 4, “ut possessor agelli
diceret, Hoec mea sunt, veteres 11119ναί6 οοίωιί.”

48. quamvis lapis . . „junco Some commentators make quamvis the
beginning of a. new sentence, putting a comma at junco, and carrying
on the phrase, non insueta . . . laedent. But it seems better to take
quamvis, &c.‚ as qualifying the words sacis mccyna, “large enough for
you, although bare 5101105 cover all the meadows, ancl the swaxnp covers
them all with muddy rushes.” The country mentioned is near the
Mincius, which often overfiows its banks, and lays the adjoining fields
under mmm—Note, that in translating from the 110015, we are often
obliged to render singular by plural, and plural by singular: so here
we have turned lapis and jcmco into the plural number. If the reader
objects to this, he may say, “Although bare 510110 covers all the
meads, and sxvamp with muddy rush o’erspreads them all.”

50. insueta pabula, “unwonted food.'’ By the word “unwonted’'
we may understand “unwholesome 3²² so we often use the word δικ-017196
as meaning something unpleasant or injurious. In the authorised
version of the Bible, the word frequently occurs in this sense:
‘⁴ strange gods,” ‘⁶ strange lips,'' δια-φανῶ foetas. Wagner translates
11115, “the sickly ewes;'' for foetas may mean “pregnant, breeding‚
teeming,” or it may mean “having just brought forth young.'' So
also φανῶ· might have the sense of maridas, “ pregnant;” or it may
mean “sickly.'' NOW‚ if we take both words in the sense of “preg-
nant,” we have a tautology; and the only possible meaning which
remains is‚‘ ‘the sickly (females) which have just brought foith their
youngj ’and 501 ‘the sickly ewes!

51. contcc9z'cc, f1om con and ῖᾶ9, 1110 root of famem, “to touch;¹
literally,‘ ‘contact;⁷’ and 11101111111010111 contaetss' “00111ηξ,11011.” Note
the lengthening of the vowel α 111 1110 root tay, and comp-aie contamen
for “contagmenj’ contamino, σοηὶιωηῐηαειο.

52. inter flzmnioza nota. Some cominentators say that this is, “be-
tween the welhknown rivers Mincio and Post and they try to identify
the exact position of the lands between those rivers5 but then they
are met by “ et fontes sacros,” which they would change to “ad fontes
sacros.'' There seems no reason for this. Why not say, “ Amid the
well—known streams and sacred fountains2'’

53. fri9zos captabis opacwa. Captum is a frequentative verb, and is
used in the sense of “trying to get, catching at, striving sor, seeking
earnestly.” It is applied to liunters, fisherinen, and fowlers. “Tan-
talus captat flumina,’' says Horace: “Domitianus muscas captare
solebat? says Suetonius. It is also applied to orators and poets seeking
for public applause—friyzos opacum is, “the shady cool‚” ale. the cool
