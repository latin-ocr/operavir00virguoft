peaci with his neighbours. Compare the soliloquy of Richard 111„
me 1-—

“ Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
Our bruised arms laezmzy up for monuments.”

mmo placida, &e A peaceful and an easy death was the termination of
his careon— unius means JunO. -

256. oscula bbcwijatoe. This may either mean “helightly touched—

e tasted the lips,’' that is, “ he gently kissed his daughter ;” or, “ he
rhowered down kisses on his daughter.” The former rendering seems
preferable, though libare has sometimes the signification of “to pour
out, to pour forth, to shower downl’, The common prose word for
“a kiss ” is bas-ium (or, suavium), whence the English synonyme
“busa'’

257. metu is for metui, the dative case. The genitive of the fourth
declension originally ended in ais and the dative in Ἰιιίἶ. As the former
term²nation was conti-acted into us, so we find the latter, ui, contracted
into ιι.

261-266. H ie—tz‘bz' fabor. This is the reading of Wakefield, Servius,
and others. Some join tibi with hic bellum yeret, making cibi a dativus
ethicus. See note on Virgil, Eel. VIII. 6, p. 1453 and Lucian, p. 102.
—Zmzyi-us belongs to volvens. The secrets of futurity are represented as
sentences inscribed in a scroll or volume—movebo, “ Ι will bring to light
—I will remus-Rutulis subactis is the dative case, instead of “post
Rutulos subactos.”

267—274. Iulo is a dative in conformity with the Greek idiom,
instead of an appositional nominative—(lum res stetit Ilia reyno. Wagner
says that this poetical expression = “ res stetit Ilia regno ’⁵ = “ res in-
columis fuit Ilio regno ” = “res Iliensium incolumes fuerunt.” He
quotes several instances (Geor. IV. 2033 AEn. ΙΙ. 56) in which stare
may be taken in the sense of incolumem esse or incolumem manere, and
also the following parallel passage from Livy I. iii. : “Nondum maturus
imperio Ascanius, AEneae filius, fuit : tamen id imperium ei ad puberem
aetatem incolume mansit. Tantisper tutela muliebri—tanta indoles in
Lavinia erat—res Latina ει regynum avitam paternumque puero stctitss'
The meaning evidently is “so long as the kingdom of Ilium—the
Trojan kingdom—stood [i.e. maintained its standing—was safe].”
Compare Euripides, Hecuba, v. 16; ἕως μὲν οὖν ’γῆς ὄρθ’ ἔκειθ’
§planura—mayn& orbes = longos annos—refirma sacerdos, “a royal
priestess.'' The allusion is to Rhea Sylvia, the mother of Romulus and
Remus. Regina (here used adjectively, like reyem in v. 21) is applied
to her as being of royal pmentage, for she was the daughterof Numitor,
King of Alba. She is called sacerdos from her having been consecrated
a Vestal Virgin.

275-277. lapoe . . . laeffus, “rejoicing in [ἵζε. ornamented with, ον
arrayed in] the tawny hide of the fostering wolf.'’ Heyne and some
other commentators contend that Romulus would not have been so
heartless as to have dressed himself in the skin of the very she-wolf
which had suckled him in his helpless and lonely babyh00d; and
insist upon our receiving nuto-icis as an ornamental epithet, applied in-
differently to any individual of the species to which his singular wet-
nurse belonged—excipiet flentem, “ shall receive in his turn [the govern-
