BOOK 1.

Ille eqo. Understand sum. [The genuineness of these four introduc-
tory lines is very questionable. Ovid and others of the ancieuts have
quoted “ Arma virumque '' as the opening words of the AEneid. It has,
in consequence, been surmised by some critics that the four precedent
lines were originally composed by Virgil, but that, after his death,
, they were expunged by Varius* to whom, in conjunction with Tucca,
Augustus had assigned the task of revising the AEneid. Others main-
tain that they were not the productim of the poet, but owe their
appearance to the invading hand of some injudiciuus grammarian. An
exordium so egotistic and spiritless is beneath the dignity of an epic
poeni as well as foi eign to the subject which it celebrates. ]—moclalatus
(sanz) is connected by et with coegyi The clause containing the fonnet-
verb refe1s to the composition of the Bucolics, that containing the
latter to the composition of the Georgics.

1. cn ma (ὅπλα) is the term gener« ally applied to weapons of defence,
such as the helmet, shield, b1 eastplate. It contains the 1001, of ἄρ -,ειν

“to fit, adapt, join ‚ '' and ther-esoxe primarily signified joinings or
fittings for the warrior's person. In this passage arma has the meaning
of bela, for Virgil is about to sing of the wars and wanderings of AEueas.
This metonymy—easy and natural enough under any circumstances—
was particularly likely to suggest itself to the mind of a Latin poet3
for, unlike most civilised nations of modern times, the Romans did not
maintuin any standing army; and it was not until the blast of war
sounded in their ears, that their soldiers rushed to arms. With them,
therefore, an armed condition was always a condition of war.

primus. The Trojan Antenor had come to Italy before AEneas, bul:
then he had not come to the Lavinian shores. Virgil, therefore, is
strictly accurate in saying that AEneas was the first Trojan to come to
Italy and the Lai-{niem shores. See verses 242—249. [Some translate
primus, “early,” ile. 0110 of 1110 first, or “ 111 remote times-’¹ Compare
AEn. ΙΙ. 263, and Georgic I. 144.]

2. Ilaliam. The expression Italiam ‘venit would not be correct prose
Latin for ‘⁴ he came 10 IraIyJ’ Rumam venit would be a correct traus-
lation for ²‘ 110 camo to Rome.’' But when the name of a place which
is not a town, follows a verb of motion, the preposition (in) is prefixed.
The poets, however, frequently omit the prepositi0n3 just as Homer

⁸* There is some indireet testimony to the currency, in earlier 1111105, of a
repert that ‹hi-³ was the case.
