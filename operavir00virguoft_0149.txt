THE Bucomcs.—ECLOGUE v. 139

The ordinary story aboub Daphnis is, thass he was a Sicilian hero, who
invented Bucolie poetry. He was be1oved by a Naiad; but. as he
proved unfaithful 1ο her, she struck him with blindness; and it is
added, that while wandering about he fell from a steep rock and was
killed. Different poets have told the taie in various ways but the
substance is always the same.

1. cur-non considimus, “why do we not sit down‚” i.e.‚ let us sit
down—boni, . . . inflare . . . diem-e: the use of the infinitive affer an
adjective is borrowed from the Greek ἀγαθοὶ συρίζειν, ἐσθλοὶ ἀείδειν.
The one was skilled in playing upon the pipe, the other in
smgmg.

2. calamos . . . leves, “the light reeds‚'' which composed the fistula
or Pau's-pipe.

4. tu major, i. e.‚ matu, ⁴‘ 111011 art the older.''

5. sive sub umbras, sire antro, &e., “ whether we go under 'the shade or
under a cave.'' The use of the dative occurs, alsO, in Georg. III. 418
“tecto succedere ei: 1110111111]’-ἠιοίαηίίὂ1ι.ς. Some read mutantibus,
others, nutantibus; but compare Ecl. VI. 28, '‘ motare eacumina.'’

6. adspice uc . . . racemis. Professor Kcy has two remarks on this
passage. He notioes the use of the indicative for the subjunctive ir
an indirect question, comparing Terence’s expression, “ vide 111 discidi
labrum,’' “see how he has ouh my lip open.'’ (See Key. Gr. ξ 1197.
And he points 0111 ‘che use of sparyere for σπερῶ-,σενα “Some transi
tive verbs, when compounded, slightly change their meaning, and 111111,
have a changed construetion3 as sparyere aquam, κ) sprinkle water3
consperqere aliquemaqud, 10 besprinkle any one with water. Only poets,
and their prose imstators, use sparyere in the sense of ‘besprinkle.''’
Ib. ξ 905.

9. quid si idem certet. Compare Ter. Heaub. IV. iii. 41, “quid si
nunc eoelum ruat.”

11. Alconis . . . aut Codri. These seem 1ο be fictitious names.
But observe that jzwyz'a Codri n=ay mean either “abuse uttered by
Codrus '' or “abiise directed against Cod1·us;” like the “injuriae
Sabinarum” of Livy.

15. tu deinde jubete), “then 111011 shalt orders This form of the
imperative has often the force of a future. Cf. Ecl. III. 77, “ipse
ve11ito,'‘ “ thou thyself shalt: come.'’

16. pallenti oliae. This must, be trans1ated “yellow '³ or “green,'’
but certainly 1101 “pale’' Cf. Ecl. II. 47, “pallentes violas‚'' and Ecl.
III. 39, “ hedera pallente?

17. saliunca, an unknown plant—perhaps the viardus celtica. Heyne.

20. Daphnin flebant, “were bewailing Daphnis.'' Cf. Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 78,
and note.

23. alque deos alque aslrct. Those who deny that atque . . . atque
can be used sor et . . . et, take complana (est) as a. verb, and make the
first atque comple the two lines—vocat is explained by Heyne as
‘i7zvocc1t,· 11111 U'agner understands ih in the usual sense, “ calls the
stars cruel,'' quoting Ter. Ad. V. vii. 13, “jam lepidus voeor.’'

24. non ulli, &e There are five spondees iu this line, 1ο mark the
heaviness and grief of mind caused by the death of Daphnis. So,
when the Cyclopes are wielding their sledge-hammers‚ we read (Georg.
IV. 174),

Illi inter sese magnii vi brachia. tollunt.
