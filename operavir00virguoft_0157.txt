THE BUCOLICs.—ECLOGUE vm. 147

in v. 55 Olrphffis is a dissyllable, but in v. 56 Orpheus. should be read
as a ‹lactv .

59. specula. The root spec· like the Greek σκεπ- is “ to see,” or Eng.
“spy ;'' and spec-ula is a “ spy—place‚“ a “ look-out place? as, for iu-
stance, a “ beacon'’ on the mountain—top; and so used for a “moun-
tai11-top” generally. Cf. v. 28, poculum, ‘⁵ a drinking-place.'⁷

61. desine, &c. Cf. Theocr. Ι. 127,

Λήγετε βωκολικᾶς, Μῶσαι, ἴτε, mmm-² ἀοιδᾶς.

63. own omnia possumus omnes, “all things we can not all‚'' i. e. wo
cannot all do every thing. The accusative of neuter adjectives and
pronouns is often found with possum t so Cicero says, quantum possim,
quantum potas ec· vales ,· similarly, quod poterant id audebant ; plus pos-
sam, plurimum possum, &c.

64. The rites and ceremonies used by women in their incantatione,
and in the making of love-charms, are described by Theocr., Idyl. IL,
and by Horace, in his Epode upon Candia, Epod. 17.

65. adole. This is a very difficult word: it is chiefly used in sacri-
ficial language, and means, “ to offer a thing as a gift upon the altar.’'
So Lucretius says (IV. 1233), “ sanguine conspergunt aras, adolentque
altaria donis.'' Virgil uses the phrases adolere altaria donis, and
cumulare altaria donis. Probably the root ole of adolere is the same as
the root of sub-oles and acl-olescens ‚· and the original idea is to “ rise,” 01·
⁴⁶ raise ;” whence, also, to “pile,‘’ 01· “ heap,'' aud thus aci-olere would
mean “ to heap on, to pile up.”

69. vel coeso, “ even from heaven.” Cf. V. 58.—carmi72a must mean
¹‘ charms or spells,” and cantando (V. ²71), “ by incantation.’'

’ἲ 4. terna licia. If terna be taken strictly as a distributive numeral,
it must mean “ three a-piece ’'—“ three threads a-piece.” Though
Wunderlich says “ terni pro tres,” quoting. in proof, AEn. V. 560. But
there were three threads‚ each of a threefold colour, and it seems quite
possible to give the numeral its proper distributive meaning of “three
each, or three a-piece.’' Further, the student may consider whether
the plural altaria must be taken as used poetically for the singular, or
whether there were really more altars than one—probably three. The
licia were the threads used in incantation‚ which were bound round the
magio wheel. Cf. Ovio, Fast. II. 575. Ladewig thinks they were bound
round the altar.

75. effiyiem. This was an image of the unfaithful lover: the super-
stition was, that incantations performed over the image would affect
the absent lover himself. These images were often made of wax, and
allowed to melt iu the magio fire. Cf. V. 80, and Theoer. II. 28, 29.
——otumero deus, &c. In English we have a common proverb, “ there is
luck in odd numbers.¹' For the use of gaudere with an ablativo, cf.
Ecl. VI. 29.

80. Limus, ὅτε. Heyne thinks that there were two images of Daphnis,
one made of clay, and the other of wax.

82. sparye molam, ‘⁶ scatter meal.’' It was customary to strew meal
on the head of victims at sacrifices.

91. exuvias. Literally exuvioe means anything taken off from the
body, whether clothing, armour, 01· even hair (see Catull. LXVI. 62) .·
