THE Bucomos.—E0L0GUE vm. 145

4. mutata . . . cursus, “having their courses changed.'’ The accusa-
tive depends upon the passive participle mutata: this is sometimes
called the Greek accusative ς but see notes on Ecl. Ι. 55, florem
depasta.

6. Tu mihi. This dative is not dependent upon any verb of the seu-
tence: it is called the dativus ethicus by the grammarians, and is
employed to express the feeling of a speaker. It is seldom translated
literally in modern English, but our older writers often used the pro·
noun iu this way with great effect. See note on Lucian's Dialogues, ed.
Young, p. 102. Pollio was returning, along the Illyrian coast, from
foreign service—Timavi. The Timavus is a river which discharges
itself into the Adriatic sea, not far from Aquileia

7. en unquam. Cf. Ecl. I. 68.

10. sola Sophocleo, Sto„ “thy poems which alone are worthy of the
buskin of Sophocles.” Pollio had composed tragcdies, no doubt
in imitation of the Greeks. Cf. Hor. Od. IL i. 9, where the poet addresseb
Pollio:

Paullum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris; mox, ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno.

11. α te principium. So Homer, Il. IX. 97, ἐν σοὶ μὲν λήξω, σέο δ’

ξομαι.
ἄ1117. Damon sings of an unhappy lover, who sees the morning
dawn, ushering the day upon which the lover's mistress is about to
marry a rival. She had often sworu by the gods to be faithful, but had
broken her vows.-—p7·oeqzae . . . vem'aemS, for et praeveniens, “coming as
harbinger of day.'’-—diem is governed by αρε, “ bring on the genial day.''

18. conjecqz‘s. Here conjux is used in the sense of “ betrothed.'' Cf.
AEn. IX. 138.

19. testibus illis, “ by their invocation.'’ The betrothed Nisa had often
called the gods as witnesses (testes).

22. Maenalus: a mountain in Arcadia, frequented by Pan, and the
haunt of shepherds,· whence “Maenalian ” is used in the sense of
Bucolic or Past01·al.——ar9atum‚ ‘¹ clear-sounding.'' This epithet, and
that of loquentes, allude either to the wind whistling through the trees,
or to the fact that the woods resound with the musical strains of Pau
and the shepherds.

24. Panaque, &c. To Pan was attributed the invention of the shep-
herd's pipe, commonly called the Pan's-pipe; it consisted of stalks or
reeds (calamis) fastened together. Cf. Eel. II. 32.

26. Mopsus is the successful rival, Nisa is the betrothed.

27. jungentur, &c., “now may griffins be yoked with horses.” The
yryps was a fabulous four-footed bird; and the poet means to say, that
since Nisa is given in marriage to Mopsus, the whole course of nature
may be subverted : griffins may be yoked with horsea and fawns may
drink at the same fountain with the hounds.

28. pocula. The root po or pi means ‘⁶ drink :” compare πῶ-μα, πό-μα,
vri-vm, &e 3 and so po-culum is here used in the litera] sense of
a. ‘¹ drinking-place :'' the usual signification is a ‘⁴ drinking-vessel,

cup,’¹ &a
