14. cultor nemorum. Aristaeus, son of Apollo and the nymph Cyrene,
was especially worshipped—as Apollo νόμως-1113 Cea, a very fruitful
island of the AEgeau Sea, one of the group called the Cyclades.

15. ter centum is poetical in a double seme: first as being a definite
for an indefinite number3 and, semmdly, as distinguished from the
more prosaic trecenti.

16. Lycoei. This was a mountain in Arcadia. Here were wont to
be celebrated the Lycaea (τὰ Λυκαΐα), festivals in honour of Pan, which
corresponded to the Roman Lupercalia.

17. ovium castos. It was by virtue of his functions as the god of
shepherds and the protector of their sheep from tho ravages of wolves
(λύκοι), that Pan received the appellation of Lycaeus (Λυκαῖος). This
must not be confounded with Lyceus (Λύκειος) an epithet of Apollo,
derived, probably, from the circumstance of his being particularly wor-
shipped at Patara, in Lycia, whence, also, Horace styles him “ Patareus
Apollo '' (Hor. Od. ΙΙΙ. iv. 64).—Moenalus was another mountain in
Arcadia. Observe the heteroclite plural Maenala.

18. Τερετεε, “Tegeaean,’' of Tegea (Τεγέα), atown of Arcadia, now
called M oli-lia. Here both Apollo and Pan were specially worshipped.—
oleaeque Minerva inventrix. From Pan, the tutelary deity of pastoral Ar-
cadia, the poet now passes on to Minerva, the patron goddess of refined
Attica. Her contention with Neptune as to which of the two should
give name to the capital of Cecropia is a circumstance often alluded to
by the poets. The assembly of gods agreed to awardthe honour to that
claimant who should confer the greatest boon upon mankind. Neptune,
striking the earth with his trident, produced a horse; Minerva called into
existence the olive. The unanimous verdict was 111 favour of Minerva,
the authoress of the emblem of peace, rather than to Neptune, who had
summoned up the symbol of war. The name Athenae (Ἀθῆναι, from
Minerva's name Ἀθήνη) was therefore bestowed upon the city, and
Minerva was recognised as its tutelary goddess. Pliny says that the
olive-trec produced on the occasion by Minerva, was to be seen (l) 111 his
time at Athens.

19. puer monstrator aratri. Triptolemus, son of Celeus, king of
Attica. Ceres taught him the use of the plough. See Ovid, Met. V.

20. ab radice, “ root and all, uprooted.” Sylvanus was an ancient
Italian god, the guardian of trees and all places planted with trees.
He was usually represented with a garland on his head and a young
cypress plant in his hand.

23. satis. This word (satis) is the dative plural of the perfect par-
ticiple of the verb serere (sero, sevi, siz‘lwm). lt might be mistaken for
the adverb (satis), were it not for the evident antithesis between it and
the words of the preceding line ‘¹ novas non ullo semine fruges.¹’

25, 26. velis governs both the infinitive invisere, aud the accusative
curam. With ‘lauziacus orbis we may understand terrm-wic, which has
been already employed at the beginning of the same line. The entire
expression reminds one of that of Shakspeare : “sole monarch ot the
univerxal earth.”

2⁸. macerm'i myrto. The house of the Julii claimed to have descended
from Venus (see the Outline of the Life of Cae ar, prefixed to Weale's
edition of caesai-‘s Gallie War). Thc myrtle wis sacred to that goddess
