73. Corn 2727721'0 is here a trisyllable (by synizesis), the two last syllables
being pronounced as ona-dicabo is from dicare, not from dicere.

76—80. Tuus. &c., ‘⁴ The task is thine‚ O Queen, to examine what it
is that thou desirest; ’tis my duty to exeeute thy commandsx’—-Fas est
capessere = nefas esset non capessere—Tu milei, διο. “ Thou hast
procui-ed for me all the empire 1 possess, thou hast gained for me my
sceptre and the favour of Jupiter5 thou hast eonferred upon me the
privilege of reelining at the banquets of the gods, and hast made me
the rulers &c. The present tenses concilias. das, facis, are used to
show the continued permanence of the privileges resulting to AEolus
from the favour of Juno, and the present nature of his obligations to
that goddess. For concilias in verse 79, if Virgil had employed clas,
the statement would have been directly contradictory to that contained
in verses 65, 66 ; “ Divfim pater . . . dedit?

81, 82. conversa* cns-pide, “with the inverted point ” of his spear. It
was common for the gods to bear a spear instead of a sceptra—There
are various interpretations assigned to the words impulit in latus.
Heyne supposes them to mean that the god ‘⁴ struck the mountain on
its side'' with such force as to make a breach for the egress of the
winds‚—that, in fact, he “stove in’' a portion of one sicle. Others
understand that AE‹›lus tilted the mountain up a little,—eareened it
over to one side,—s0 as to open a passage for the winds at the bottom
of that side which was raised from the ground.

83. Compare Thoinson's XVinter z “ Then issues forth the storm with
sudden burst.'' And Milton, Paradise Regained :

“. . . Nor slept the winds
Within their stony cave, but rush’d abroad
From the four hinges os the world.''

With Virgil's entire description of the storm, compare, also, Homer
Od. E. 291-314.—Obse1ve that in this line ruunt is intransitive3
but in verse 85, it is transitive, governing tolum (mare).
84—86. “. . . On the passive main
Descends th* ethei-eal force, and with strong gust
Turns from its bottom the discolour'd deep,”
Tnonson.
88—91. Eripiunt subito . . . omnia mortem.
‘¹ For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but eonvey unto our fem-sul minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death.'’
ΞΗΑΚΞΡΕΑΒΕ, Comedy of Errors.

92. Extemplo, διο. “Forthwith the limbs of AEneas are paralysed
[solz-untur, ‘are unncrved, relaxed’] with a chill ” of horror. Fear and
amazement freeze his blood and prostiate his powers. Compare
AEneid III. 175, and XII. 905. [fflrhe objections of those eritics
who, from this passage, arraign AEneas of eowardice, are most weak
and frivolous. All sear is not cowardiee, as no fierceness is true
courage. He is afraid of the gods and for his country. Achilles,
merely for a personal affront and the loss of a mistress, runs away
crying and tells his mothel-3 and she comes with her τέκνον, τί
κλαίεις; (what are you crying for, dearl) and yet the same critias
never object against the courage of that hero.’' TRAPP]
