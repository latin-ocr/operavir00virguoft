strictly appropriate. Thereis aremarkable instance of this figure 111 the
book of Exodus, where it is said that all the people SAW the lightning ana
the NOISE of the THUNDER. In the passage of Virgil under considera-
tion adinrare can hardly be said to be applicable to such a subject as
tenues plzwioe. With regard to its connection with penetrabile fri-qus, we
may remark that urere and its compounds in Latin, and καίειν and its
compounds in Greek, are often used of the effecte of cold, as well as of
the action of heat. Compare Cic. Inst. II. 2, “Scythae continuis
frigoribus uruntur:'’ Cic. Tusc. Il. xvii. 40, “ pernoctant venatores in
nive, in montibus uri se patiuntur:'' Xenophon, Anabasis, VII. iv. 3,
ῥῖνες ἀπεκαίοντο, “their noses were frost-bitten;” aud IV. v. 3,
ἀποκαίων πάντα, “freezing everything up.’⁷ Pliny repeatedly applies
adm-ere to the action of cold.

94—99. “ He, besides, who breaks the inert clods with the rakes, and
drags the osier harrows, much assists the fields; nor does auburn
Ceres look on him indifferently from lofty Olympus: and he, too,
[benefits the fields] who with turned plough again breaks through
transversely the ridges which he raises in cutting through the plain,
thus frequently exercising the earth and disciplining the fields.'' In
these lines a constant working of the soil by means of cross-ploughing,
and by the use of the rake and harrow, is recommended. This
minute breaking up, or pulverisation of the soil, is technically termed
occatio.

94. rastris. The rastrzmn resembled the Greek δίκελλα, and our
“raka'' It was toothed‚ and used by hand. The sat-cahom (μάκελλα,
i.e.‚ μια-κελλα) corresponded to our hoe.

95, 96. crates. Hence the English “crate”—flara Oet-es, Homer's
ξανθὴ Δημητὴρ. Ceres was so called from the colour of ripe corn.
—neqm'cquam speclat is an instance of litotes or meiosis (λιτότης,
μείωσις), where less is expressed than it is the evident inten-
tion of the speaker or writer to convey. By saying that Ceres
does not look down upon him with indiffwence, Virgil gives us to
understand that she regards him favourably and blesses him with
abundant harvests.

98 ’ἱη obliquum. That is, at right angles to the first plonghing.

loo-117. “ Pray, ye farmors, for dripping sunnner-solstices [Ξ sum-
mers] and for clear winters; with winter dust the corn is most
luxuriant, the field is fertile: [in such a climate, and] not in any
culture [it may receive] does Mysia boast itself so much, and Gargara
wonder at its own crops. What shall I say of him who, when he has
cast his seed, forthwith sets to work upon the fields and levcls the
heaps of barren earth; then brings down upon what is sown the brook
with its chasing cui-rents3 and when the parched field with its dying
vegetation pants with heat, lo, from the brow of the mountain channel,
invites the water l—this, in its descent, produces a hoarse murmur
among the smooth-worn stones, and cools the thirsty soil with its
gushing streams. What am I to say of him, who, lest the stalk should
prematurely incline with the heavy ears, depastures [i.e.‚ suffers the
cattle to graze upon] the exuberance of the produce 111 the young
plant, as soon as the issue of the seed attains the level of the furrost
and of him who ‹li-ains off from the absorbent saud the collected
moistl re of the marsh‘? especially if, in the uncertain months, the
