emonem 1. 107

And, finally, Dryden's rendering is—

There, as they say, perpetual night is found

In silence brooding on th' unhappy ground;

Or, when Aurora leaves our northern sphere,

She lights the downward heav'n, and risos there}
And when on us she breathes the living light,
Red Vesper kindles there the tapers of the night.

But intempestus is often used in the sense of “ unwholesome. unseason-
able, unhealthy;” and there seems to be a peculiar propriety in thus
translating it, when employed as a poetical epithet of the disnial⁵
gloomy night. And although there may be no etymological relationship
between the roots of ‘nox and nocere, it can hardly be denied that there
is often a disposition on the part of the poets to connect night with
that which is pestilent and injurious and noxious—even with death
itself.

265. Amerina. Ameria was the name of a city of Umbria in Italy,
reputed for an abundance of the best speeies of willow.

20⁴7. torrete, “ parch‚'' preparatorily to grinding it.

269. rivos deducere. That is, to drain the fields, or, to draw off the
water which had been let in upon them in the process of irrigatistn.

272. salubri. It was forbidden to wash the sheep on holy days, if
merely for the purpose of cleansing the wool; but as a measure of
health, or for the cure of disease‚ it was allowable.

274. pomis. Pom ztm is used by the ancient& not only for apples, but
for all esculent fruits. Frm't is used by bztcanists to signify the seeds
of any plant with their eovering; but in common acceptation it agrees
exactly with what the ancients meant by pomum. (Martyn.)

279. Cf. Homer, Od. XI. 305—320,· Ovid, Met. Ι. 151-160.

284. septima post decimam, “the seventeenth.” But some translate
“the seventh is lucky, next to the tenth.''

299. Nudus ara &Q “ The fiist Georgic was probably burlesqued in
the author's life-time3 for we still find in the Scholiasts a velse that
ridicules part of a line translated from Hesiod, ‘nudus ara. sele nudus!
And we may easily guess at the judgment of this extraordinary critic,
whoever he was, from his censuring this particular precept. We may
be sure Virgil would not have translated it from Hesiod, had he not
discovered some beauty in it3 and indeed the beauty of it is what Ι
have before observed to be frequently met with in Virgil, the delivering
the precept so indireetly‚ and singling out the particular circumstance
of sowing and ploughing naked, to suggest to us that these employ-
ments are proper only in the hot season of the year.'' (Addison.) The
passage from Hesiod is,

. . . ’γυμνὸν σπείρειν, ’γυμνὸν δὲ βοωτεῖν,

’γυμνὸν δ’ ἇμᾶσθαι.
Pliny relates, that when the envoys of the Senate came to Cincinnatus
to offer him the dictatorship, they found him naked, ploughmg:
“ Aranti quatuor sua jugera in Vaticano, quae prata Quintia appellantur,
Cincinnato viator attulit dictaturam, et equidem, ut traditur, nudo,
plenoque pulveris etiamnum ore. Cui viator, Vela corpus, inquit, ut
proferam Senatus Populique Romani mandata.'' Respecting the
meaning of nudus in such passages, see note on verse 58.
