THE BucoLics.——E0L0GUE v1. 141

61. bonus, “benignant‚ beneficent.” So v. 65, “sis bonus ς ” and
AEn. XII. 647, “VOS, O mihi Manes, este boni.’'-—otioe. Cf. Ecl. I. 6.

63. intonsi = iozcaedui, “not cut? and so, covered with wood.

64. carmina sonant, “re-echo the songs.'' Cf. Hor. Epod. IX. 5,
“sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra.”

66. duas, altaria. The old reading was duoque altaria, and some
read duo altaria. The reading of the text is accepted by the
critics, and they explain it thus : that ara is the general name for an
altar, but altare is an altar for burnt sacrifice ; then they take altaria
as used in apposition with duas .· “ see, here are four altars—10 ! two
for thee, Daphnis, and two high altars for Phoebus.'' We see from the
following lines that Daphnis was to be honoured, not by burnt sacrifice,
but by libations of milk, oil, and wine.

70. aute, δια, “before the fi1·e,if cold it be, if harvest, ’neath the
shade.’'

71. vina Ariusia. So called from Ariusia a district in the island of
Chios—calathis, “ from the wine-cups or wine-jars : '¹ the word occurred
in Ecl. ΙΙ. 46, in the sense of “ baskets ; '⁷ it is also used for a “ milk·
pail.'’ Cf. Georg. ΙΙΙ. 402.

80. damnabis. In a legal sense damnare means “ to bind or oblige‚''
αδ, for instance, by last will and testmnent, to bind the heir to the per-
formance of a certain act, and then it is used generally, “ to oblige any
one to perform an act; '¹ and it may have an ablative case denoting the
act. So Lucr. IV. 1179, “ stultitiaque ibi se damnet,”—where‚ however,
some read stultitiae. The meaning of the passage is that Daphnis,
being a god, will compel men to pay their vows to him.

82. venientis sibilus Austri, “the whistle of the coming south wind: '⁹
by “ coming” he means “ rising.'’

85. ante, “ before,‘’ i.e. “before you do, first-’³ Menalcas says, he will
be the first to make a present, and will bestow upon Mopsus a slender
Pan‘s-pipe.-ante; see note on Ecl. 111. 65.——cicutd, “hemlock :⁵⁷ and
then used for the pipe which was made of hemlock stalks. Cf.
Ecl. II. 36.

88. pedum, ‘¹ a shepherd's crook τ ” this word does not appear to be
found in any other classieal author.

ECLOGUE VL—SILENUS.

ARGUMENr.-—Virgil begins by saying that his first efforts were in the
style of Bucolic poetry. He then attempted Epic strains, but Apollo
warned him not to forsake the shepherd's lays. Accordingly, he goes
on (v. 13) to sing of Silenus, who was caught asleep, and obliged to
obey the wishes of his captors. Silenus is required to give proof of his
musical powers3 and, beginning from the creation of the world, he
recounts some fables borrowed from the Greek mythology, except-
ing a few lines (v. 64—73> where the praises of Gallus are in-

troduoed.
