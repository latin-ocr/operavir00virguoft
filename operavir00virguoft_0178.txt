306. Lam-i, “the bay-t1·ee.‘’—crzoenta‚ “with blood-red juice.''

309. Balearis. The Baleares (sc. insulae) were two islands in the
Mediterranean Sea, so called from the skill of their inhabitants in the
use of the sling. Their name was derived from the Greek βάλλειν.
They are now known as Majorca and Minorca.

324. ex alto, “from the deep.’' This is the interpretation of Voss,
and appears to be the one which best harmonises the poet's expression
with the natural fact. Heyne translates ex alto, “from the sky’⁷ ( = ex
coelo), upon which rendering Keightley remarks that it does not place
the poet in the light of a very accurate observer of nature. Servius
translates it, “from the north'’ (= a septentrione) 3 but, as Ruaeus
reminds us, storms generally come from the south, and the poet a few
lines afterwards says “ingeminant Austri.‘'

328. coruscri l have marked as an ablative in agreement with dextra,-
though some regard it as an accusative agreeing with fulmina. Cf.
Horace,- Od. I. ii. 2, 3,

. . . Pater, et rubente
Dextera sacras jaculatus arces,
Terruit urbem.

Dr. Trapp, connecting coruscfl with dextra, translates :

Great Jove himself, amidst the night of clouds,
Hurls with his red riyht hand the forky fire.

So, too, May :

In midst of that tempestuous night, great Jove
From a brsigykt hand his winged thunder throws.

Dryden, in his version, adopts the other interpretation.

334. “ Now the woods, now the shores reverberate with the mighty
blast.⁷' With Heyne, we have taken plaozywzt as eqnivalent to plan-
yorem edunt, resonant. Strictly it is the sea which plmzyit, “strikes, or
lashes” the shore so as to make it resound. Here, however, the
shore is said itself planycre, and, indeed, the words also. Ladewig
compares Sophocles, Antigone, v. 593, στόνῳ βρέμουσι δ’ ἀντιπλῆγες
ἀκταί. From the above explanation there are, however, not a few (lis-
sentients‚* as may be seen from the following note of Martyn, who,
however, accepts the interpretation of Heyne :—Servius reads plangit,
and interprets it resonare j'acic : but he acknowledges that others read
plangunt. Pierius says it is planytt in the Roman and some other very

⁴⁹ Keightley has the following note: “The construction seems to be to
this effect, ‘ The south winds (or, rather, the winds in general), which are
attended by heavy rain, lash the woods and shores with furious gnsts.' We
meet venti pla‘nfflmt in Lucretius, vi. 114. The following is the rendering
ot Dr. Trapp, together with his note :

‘. . . With redoubled force
The winds condense the tempest: woods roar loud
With struggling blaste3 and rivers lash their shores.

There is an elcgancy in that word planyunt in this place not to be·
expressed in our language.''’
