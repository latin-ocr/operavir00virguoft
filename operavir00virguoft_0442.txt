against her slighted beauty consisted in the preference given to that of
Venus.-9enus invisum. Dardanus, the founder of the kingdom of
Troy was an o‘bject of dislike to the jealous Juno, inasmuch as he was
the son of her husband Jupiter by Electra. This aversion on the part
of the goddess extended itself to his descendants, the Troiana—‘rapta‘
Ganymedis honores, ‘¹ the honours conferred upon the stolen Ganymedes·
Baptz' Ganymedis is here again an objective genitive. Hebe, daughter ot
Juno, was the original cupbearer to the gods. Dismissed from her
office by Jupiter, because she accidentally stumbled while serving the
nectar, she was succeeded by Ganymede, the son of Tros. This youth
had been stolen away by Jupiter (who was struck with his beauty)
while tendiug his father's flocks on Mount Ida.

29. lais accensa super, “with these things inflamed, moreover,” fired
with these reflections besides the irritating considerations specified in
vv. 19—24. Some, with, perhaps, greater reason, consider super as a
preposition governing the ablative lzisg in which case we may translate
“ on these accounts iufla1ned.⁷’

30. reliquias Danaum, “ the leavings of the Greeks‚'’ those who had
been spared by, or who had escaped from, the Greeks. The Greeks
were called Danai from Danaus, who, with his fifty daughters settled
in Greece, and founded Argos.

33. Virgil commences his narrative with the departure of AEneas
from Sicily, in the seventh year aster the destruction of Troy. The
incidents preceding this point in his wanderings are related by AEneas
himself to Dido in the second and third books, and the nai-ration is
afterwards rcsumed by the poet. ⁶

35. cere, “with the brassss’ with which the ship, and especially the
prow or cutwater‚ was bound. (Compare oerea puppis in v. 198.)
Translate: “they were ploughing [ruebant Ξ sulcabant] the foam of
the sea with the prOW.'’ AEs is often put to represent any instrument,
or implement made tlierel'rotn: in ΙΙ. 734, we have (cra for arma cerea,-
in III. 111, we have (ενα for the brazen cymbals (cymbala) of the Cory-
bantes ; in VI. 165, cere cim-c rivos = cerea culmi, &c-

36. Mene incepto, &Q “ls it for me, baffled, to desist,'’ &c The
accusative with the infinitive is osten thus used, in impassioned excla-
mations, and may be considered to depend upon some understood
verb, as decet, oeqztnm est, credibile est. &c The interrogative oze is
generally appended to the most emphatic word, that being also the first·
word in the sentence. Cf. Cic. Div. II. 13, 30: “Hunccine hominem
tantis delectatum esse magisY'

40. In AEneid ΙΙ. 403 -405 we have an allusion to the violence
offered to Cassandra in the temple of Minerva by the Locrian Ajax, the
son of Oileus. The offended Minerva shattered his ficet on its honic-
ward voyage, struck him with lightning, and impaled his con-pse upon a
rock. Other authors, however, differ soinewhat from Virgil in their
account of the mode of Ajax's destruction. Oilei is here a trisylluble,
just as in verse 120 Ilib'ncz is a quadrisyllable.

41. ipsa. The force of this word, which indicates that Pallas with
her own hand inflicted surnninry vengeance upon Ajax and his crew, is,
