231, 232. “’Tis for this [i. e. for the guidance of the husbandman]
that the golden sun of the system divides into constant [i. e. not
variable] portions the path which he steers through the twelve signs
[of the zodiae].'' If we would avoid a complete misrepresentation of a
Latin author's meaning, we must often violate one of the first preeepts
of the advocates of what they call “ literal translation (?),’' namely, ⁴‘ to
render a verb by a verb, and a participle by a participle.” In the

verb 3 and the reason is, that idcirco is more intimately connected with
that participle than with regit. It is not that the sun makes his revo-
lution, so much as that he measures it out into fixed parts, which direets
the farmer 111 his labours. I have joined mundi with Soh· so we have
“ clarissima mundi lumina '¹ at the beginning of this Georgic. Mundus
and κόσμος (10 not differ much in their inherent signification from our
word “ system ;’' and the system par excellence—the solar system—was
with Virgil the “ universe.’'—Sob aureus. This is a poetical expression
of frequent occurrence. Ennius has “ simul aureus exoritur sol‚''
which is like Benvolio's

247, 248. ‘⁴ There [meaning at the south pole, 'illam in verse 242, just
as hic, the adver'b 111 v·e1se 244, means the north pole, answ ering to the

by Keightley‘ ‘daok night,' 1n which nothing can be done.' Ladewig
explains by a reference to the deadly silence of the night, when all
employments cease. Heyne says: “nox ioztenmcstajam Ennio et Lucretio

There vesper reddens late, and lights the stars.
