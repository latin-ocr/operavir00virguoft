come him in a chariot-race‚ and who should be content to pay th·

penalty of death in the event of being himself overcome. Now, th«

horses of OEnomaus had been begotten of the Winds, and were of extra·
ordinary fleetness. Nevertheless, Pelops vemtured, and gained the
victory. Some say that his success was owing to stratagem, he having
bribed the charioteer of OEnomaus, who mounted his master on an
unsound chariot, which broke down and caused his death. Others-—
whom Virgil follows, as is shown by the words acer equis—ascribe the
victory of Pelops to his own skill, and to the assistance of Neptune, who
had furnished him with winged horses.

12. Idumea, a part of Judaea‚ was famous for its palms.

19, 20. ‘¹ For 1ne all Greece shall abandon Alpheus [a river of Pelopon-
nesusl, and the groves of Molorchus, and contend in running, and with
the bloody caestus.’' The caestzcs was made of raw hides, loaded with
iron. To crudus I have assigned it< primary signification; but Heyne
understands it asze corio crudffl Martyn translates “with the hard
caestus ;” and Dr. Trapp renders “with the riyid cest.'’

. 25. “ And how the Britons, interwoven thereon, raised up the purple
cu1·tains.'' That is, how, in our theatres, the curtain rises, and displays
to the andience the grim figures of Britons interwoven on it.

28, 29. undantem bello Nilum. This refers to the victory of Antony
and Cleopatra over the Egyptians, A. U. C. 724.

30. Niphaten. A mountain in Armenia.

42. te siue. Anastrophe for sine te.

46. Moae tamen ardentes acci729a⁷·‚ 818. In the King's manuscript it is
etiam instead of tamen. Here he is generally understood to mean, that
he intends, as soon as he has finished the Georgics, 10 describe the wars
of Augustus, under the character of AEneas. Mr. Β- 18 quite of another
opinion: “This pasmgess’ says he, “the commentators understand of
the AEneid3 but it is plainly ineant of the fourth Georgia. There he
describes the ardentes puynas, the civil wars betwixt the same people
for the sake of rival kings. In this sense the passage is very sublime,
to promise to introduce such a matter in talking of bees; but in 0118
poem to promise another is low, and unworthy of Virgss, and what
never entered into his imaginationfi But surely Mr. B— must be
mistaken in this piece of criticism, for the whole introduction to this
Georgic is a prelude to the AEneid: and I do not see how the fights of
the bees ean be understood to be a description of the wars of Caesar;
which the poet expressly says he designs to sing. (Martyn.)

48. prima ob ονίῃίηε, “ from the remote origin.’'

52. tuo-pe caput, “an ugly head,'’ say some. But others translate “a

ἓ82. spadices ylaucique, “bay and grey.”—albis et ρὶῑυο, “white and

86. armo is from armus, “ a shouldeff'

89. Amyclaei Pollucis. Castor and Pollux were educated at Amyclae
in Laconia. Since it is Castor whom the Greek poets unite in describing
as the most distinguished horseman of the two, Virgil is generally sup-
posed to have put Pollux for Castor, “ by a poetic licence'’ according
to some, but from a lapsus memoriae according to others.

92, 93. A Greek legend relates Kronos (Saturni) to have been the
father of the Centaur Chiron by the nymph Phillyra; and that to elude
