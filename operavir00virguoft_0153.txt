THE BUCOLICS.—ECLOGUE vx. 143

, vultures who tormented Prometheus when he was chained to a rock

in the Caucasus, and punished for the crime of stealing fire from
heaven.

43. Itis, &c To this he adds the fable of Hylas, a companion of
Hercules in the Argonautic expedition, who went to draw water on
the coast of Mysia, and was carried off by the nymphs. The Argo<
nauts long sought for him, and called him by name (Hyla), but all
1n vain.

45. et fortunamm, &c He alludes to the ill-fated love of Pasiphae,
who was enamoured of a bull 3 hence he says, that it would have been
well for her if herds had never existed.

46. solatur. When the poet says that Silenus “consoles Pasiphae
with love ofthe show—white bull,’‘ he must mean that Silenus describes
her affection for that animal. We can hardly translate solatur amore,
“ he consoles her for her love.'' The ablative with this verb always
denotes the means whereby comfort is afforded.

48. Proetides : the daughters of Proetus, who were punished by J uno
for their pride. They were driven mad, and imagined themselves to
be cows. Hence the force of the word falsie, “imaginary.’'—These
lines. . . . form part of an appeal to the unhappy girl (vio-90 iwzfilz'x),
Pasipha& and the argument is, that though the daughters of
Proetus imagined themselves to be cows, yet they never sought to
unite themselves with cattle. And then, again (v. 50), Pasiphae is
apostrophised.

53. ille, i.e. the bull.—latus πίυειιηι fultus, “having his snow-white
side supported by.'' Compare v. 15.

60. stabula ad Gortynia, “ to the Gortynian stalls:'' alluding to
Gortyna, a city of Crete. The scene of this fable about Pasiphae was
laid in Crete.

61. puellam.- that is, Atalanta. The story of Atalanta and the
golden apples is related by Ovid, Met. X. 565.

62. Tam, Sto. The sisters of Phaethon were changed into trees. and
their tears were converted into amber. Virgil turns these maidens into
alder trees ,¹ other poets turn them into poplars.—circamdat. Virgil
represents Silenus as doiny that which he describes. In v. 46, he
cheered Pasiphae3 now he changes the Phaethontiads into trees. The
fancy of the poet actually makes the thing of which he speaks,
And this is the sense of the Greek word ποιητής, “a maker.'⁷

70. Ascraeo seni, ‘⁴ to the Ascraean old man‚'' 226. Hesiod, who lived at
Ascra, a village in Boeotia.

72. Grynei nemoris. Grynium, or Grynia, was a town of AEolis in
Asia Minor, celebrated for a temple of Apollo.

73. »Scyllam Nisi, ‘⁸‘ Scylla the daughter of Nisus.” Other poets make
her the daughter of Phorcus, 01· Phorcys.
