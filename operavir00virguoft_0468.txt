14. Daedalus, an Athenian artist of renowned skiss, killed his sister’s
son. In consequence of this crime he fied to Crete. Here he con-
structed the labyrinth for Minos, the reigning king of the island.
Subsequently Daedalus incurred the displeasure of Minos, and was
along with his son Icarus confined in the labyrinth. By the aid of
some feathers and wax, however, he contrived to fashion for each a
pair of wings. With these they took flight over the sea in a northerly
direction (ad Arctos). Icarus soared too high, so that the heat of the
sun melted the wax with which his wings were attached to his body,
and he fell into that part of the ocean thence called the Icariau Sea.
Daedalus, however, arrived safely in Sicily, aud afterwards at Cumae 111
Campania. This exploit of Daedalus, and the fate of Icarus, are sub<
jects of frequent mention in the ancient and modern poets. Compare
Shakspeare's Hem-y VI„ Act v. Scene 6 :

‘⁴ G‘lo'ster. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a sowi!
And yet, for all his wings, the sool was drowned.

sentations, the scene of the one pair being Athens, of the other pair
Crete. Androgeo is the Greek (Attic) genitive Ἀνδρόγεω, from Ἀνδρό-
γεως. Androgeos was a son of Minos. At Athens he greatly distin-
guished himself as a wrestler, and overcame every antagonist who
ventured to offer himself. This excited the envy of the Athenians, and
he was assassinated. Minos avenged his murder-ed son, and compelled
the Athenians (Cecropidoe) every year to send to Crete seven youths
and seven maidens to be devoured by the Minotaur. The victims
were, of course, chosen by lot- (stat ductis sortibus urna).

23. conto-a, “ 011 the opposite leaf'' of the door.—Gnossia tellus means
