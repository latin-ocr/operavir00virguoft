 

THE sueonos—ECLOGUE 1. 121

68. palumbes. Besides the form palumbes, we find palumbus and
palumba 3 and by the common interchange of p with c, we find the word
appear-ing as columbus and columba.

62. pererratis amborum finibus, “ having wandered over each other’s
lands.”

63. Ararim. objections have been raised that the river Arar or
Araris, now the Saone, is a river of Gaul, and not of Germany, as the
antithesis would lead us to expect. Others defend Virgil by saying
that he purposely makes his shepherds ignorant of geography Others
maintain that after wandering through Germany‚ these Parthians
might advance to the Arar in Gaul. But, after all, are we quite sure
that no other river was called Arar? We have the Aar in Switzer-
land, which looks rather like it. ’

65. at nos alii . . . pars, “but some of us . . . others of us.'’ The
usual construction is alii . . . alii. or pars . . . pars: but sometimes
the two constructions are mixed together. So Tac. Hist. IV. 23, “ ut

alii supergtantes tamquam ex aggere proeliarentur3 pars intus occulti
muros su ruerunt.

67. Britannos. Cf. Hor. Od. I. xxxv. 29 ε

serves iturum Caesarem in ultimos
Orbis Britannos.

68. en, unquam, διο. Cf. v. 72, “ en, quo discordia cives‚’' and v. 73,
“ en. queis consevimus agros.” It is sometimes difficult to translate this
interjection en in English3 the French voicz' and υθτῖῖὰ would often help
a Frenchman out in his translation, but in English we are deficient in
interjections and particles. In AEn. IV. 534, we find, En, quid ayo?
“ well now, what am I doing2'’ Cf. Georg. ΙΙΙ. 42, Εη aye, seques mmpe
moras. Ecl. VIII. 7, en erit unquam ille dies . . . en erit ut liceat . . ,ἒ
The lines 68-70 present some difficulty3 first of all, we want to see
what governs patrios fines and culmen, and then we wish to know the
use of post. Some commentators join post aliquot aristas, which they
translate “after some years,’' but this is a violent use of the word
aristas. We must recollect that post may be used absolutely for postea,
even though a very tempting accusative follows ; as AEn. ΙΙ. 216,

gost-ipsum auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferenttm
orrlpiunt3

where we must translate “afterwards they seize himseffff’ Heyne’s
explanation is this, that mea regma is in apposition with patrios fines
aud culmen, all being governed by videns, and he makes aliquot aristas
dependent upon mirabor. ‘⁶ Well, well ! shall I ever, along time hence,
(when seeing) my fathers’ land, and the turs-heaped roos of my poor
cabin, (shall Ι) hereafter, when I see these my kingdoms, have a few
ears of corn to admire2” The following lines seem to support this
interpretati0n3 for the soldiers who were allowed to seize the confis-
cated lands, were notorious for allowing them to turn to waste.

71. culta novalia, “cultivated fields.” In general novalia means

“fallow lands,” or “meadows;'’ here the epithet culta shows that
ploughed land is intended.

73. queis consevimm agros, “for whose benefit have we sown our
fields.’'—queis for quibus: we find the same use of the dative in Cic.
