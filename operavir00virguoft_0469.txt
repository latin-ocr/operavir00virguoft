“ θνίιη-υἰεαρεά war has smooth’d his wrinkled frontJ’

165. It is remarked by Servius that Virgil originally wrote merely
the words cere ciere viros, leaving the verse uncompleted; and that
the conclusion Martemque accendere cantu. was an impromptu addi-
tion which suggested itself to him as he was reciting the sixth book to
Augustus.

883. This pathctic tribute to the memory of the young Marcellus,—
who had died suddenly at Baiae in the nineteenth year of his age,—
was recited by the poet in the presence of Octavia, the mother of the

her recovcry. ordered Virgil to be presented with ten sesterces for each
line of his incomparable panegyric.
