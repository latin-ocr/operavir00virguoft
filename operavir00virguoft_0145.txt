THE BUCOLICS.—ECLOGUE iv. 135

a sort of golden age, abounding in all manner of happiness, See the
description in Georg- Ι. 125, &e IL 536, &c.

8. Τιι modo . . . casta Lucina, “‹lo but thou, O chaste Lucina.”
Lucina is a name applied to the goddess who presided over childbirth,
and is given sometimes to Juno, at other times to Diana. In the pre-
sent passage Diana seems to be alluded to, for her brother is 11111118-
diately mentioned, “ tuus jam regnat Apollas—nascenti puero fave, “look
with favour upon the boy at his birth.'' Note the use of the present
imperfect participle nascenti, “ when he is being born,'' as in v. 5,
πρωρέων, “is coming into being.'' Cf. Hor. Od. IV. iii. 2,

Quem tu Melpomene semel
Nascentem placido lumine videris.

The superstition of the ancients drew omens from all the attendant
circumstances of childbirth.

quo, This must mean “by whose agency;'' it can hardly mean
“in whose time;'’ and yet Heyne (ed. Wagner) asserts that there is
nothing in the Eclogue to justify the notion that the boy 15 the founder
(caecator) of the promised happiness.

11. te consule, “ 111 thy consulship ; ” 50 below “te duce? “under thy
guidance.’' Cf. Ecl. Ι. 78, “me pascente; ²* and Ecl. ΙΙ. 27, “judice
te.''-—- decus hoc (evi, ‘⁴ this glory of the age‚'' for “ this glorious age.'' It
might be explained as an epithet of the child,just as Horace app-,ies the
word to Maecenas, ‘⁶ 0 et praesidium et dulce decus 111811111,“’ Od. I. 1, 2.

13. si qua manent, “ ifany such remain : ” after si the neut. plur. of
quis is qna, and not qzcae.

14. irrita, “of no force, powerless.'' So in Roman law testamentum
irritum was “a will which, being null and void, had no effect in point
of law.” Irritus is compounded of in and ratus. So Ter. Phorm. “qnod
dictum, indictum est; quod modo erat ratum, irritum est.⁷’

15. ille, 2'.e. “the boy.'' In these verses it is fore'rold that he will
associate with gods and heroes, and rule over a peaceful, or rather a
pacified world—The participle pacatus implies that wars had been
going on lately. Caesar often uses the word when speaking of his con-
quests in Gaui—patriis may be said of the boy’s “father,” or of his
“ forefathers ’⁷ in general; but compare V. 26, “ et facta parentis,'’

18. munuscula, “little gifts‚” suitable for a child, and an earnest of
the rich blessings which were to follow-nullo cultio, “ without any
tilling.'' So Hesiod, when speaking of the golden age, says, καρπὸν δ’
ἔφερε ζείδωρος ἄρουρα Αὐτομάτη πολλόν τε καὶ ἄφθονον.

19. ἶπες-ναν, sometimes written bacchar, a kind of fragrant plant, oth er-
wise called nardum rusticum. The commentators cannot decide what
particular plant this is. The Greek word βάκκαρις or βάκχαρις occurs,
but the exact meaning of it is equally unknown. Cf. Ecl. VH. 27,
where the plant is recommencled as an amnlet against evil spells.

20. colocasia. The coloeaximn (Gr. κολοκάσιον) 01· “Egyptian bean ''
was a beautiful plant, resembling a water-li1y3 it grew in the marshy
districts of Egypt, and was esteemed a choice luxury for eating.

21. ips-ce, “of themselves, of their own accord.⁷' Cf. Cic. Div. Ι. 34,
“valvae subito se ipsoe aperuerunt ; ” 1(1. de off. Ι. xxii. 77. ‘· delapsa
arma ipsa ceciderunt.” So below, v. ⁵23, “ipsa cunabula,'' unless you
prefer to translate it, “the very,'' &c.
