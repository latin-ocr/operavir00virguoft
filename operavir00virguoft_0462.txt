304. Hectoreum tumulum means, not Hector's tomb, but a cenotaph
erected to the memory of Hector; what Ovid calls a ‘⁶ tumulus sine
corpore,’' = κενοτάφιον. The consummate art and pathos of this entire
passage are thus dilated on by Dr. Trapp: The account which Andro-
mache afterwards gives of her own and Helen's adventures, of Pyrrhus,
Hermione, and O1·estes‚—all comprised in twelve lines‚—appeared so
considerable to Monsieur Rae-ine, that a part of it only has given him
the plan of an excellent tragedy, which is very well fitted for our
theatre‚ under the title of The Distressed Mother. But what scene is
there in that, or in almost any other tragedy, at once so moviug and
surprising as this wonderful meeting of AEneas and Andromache? She
is, as it were, a foreigner in her own kingdom, and, although a wife, is
pel-forming the office of a widow It is at some distance from the city,
in a wood near a river, where she is paying the funeral ceremonirs to
the memory of Hector, her first husband. This is an image of the
most glowing sadness, and the sudden turn from this to the surprise
that follows is to the last degree affectiug. For while her soul is in
this melancholy situation, she sees a prince of her own country and
family, whom she thought long ago dead, advancing towards her. Had
she even thought that he were living, she could scarcely have expected
to see him anywhere, and least of all there. What theu is the effect os
this strange rencontre? (Ut me conspexit, &c.) She doubts whether it

be he, or his ghost. She saints: for a time she is insensible ς at last
half roeovering, she exelaims,

Verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius affers,
Nate Dea ! vivisne? aut, si lux alma recessit,
Hector ubi ests}

The last enquiry is incomparably natural and pathetic.
