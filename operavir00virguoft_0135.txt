THE BU00L1cs.—ECL0GnE 11. 125

passage in his rendering. 'Phe original is as follows: Theocritus is
speaking of Polyphemus the CyclopS‚ and he says:

Καὶ ’γάρ θην οὐδ’ εἶδος ἔχω κακὸν ὥς με λέγοντι·

³1⁴ ’γὰρ πρὰν ἐς πόντον ἐσέβλεπον, ἧς δὲ γαλάνα,

Καὶ καλὰ μὲν τὰ γένεια, καλὰ δ’ ἐμὶν ἁ μία κώρα,
Ὡς παρ’ ἐμὶν κέκριται, κατέφαινετο.

“For in good sooth, neither have Ι so villanous a countenance, as
they say I have 3 for lately I was looking into the sea (and there was a
calm), and beautiful seemed my chin, beautiful seemed my eye, as far
as Ι couldjudge.” μ

26. placidum, ventis. This is an unusual expression. He means that
the sea was calm: but there is some difficulty in the ablative ventis.
The ablative may always be used where there is the sense of ·‘ motion
fr0m‚'' or “ freedom from '⁵ anything. And so here, the calmness was
caused by freedon] from wind. But qunderlich would rather under-
stand this as the ablative of the means “ whereby‚” comparing AEn. V.
763, “placidi straverunt aeqnora venti; '' in which passage the winds
are represented as actually Sinoothing down the waters.

27. judice te, “if you were to be the judge.” See note on Ecl. Ι. 78,
me asceute.

ἐξ. o tantum libeat tibi, ‘⁴' oh, that you were only willing ; '¹ literally,
“ oh, that it only liked thee.’' The old form of libet was labet, and we
see the same root in lubido, and perhaps also in the German lust,
English liis-t, ἰαετῃ, &e

sordidarum, “a humble sarm.” Sordidus is, originally, “unclean,
filthy,” and then used for anything “ low, mean, or humble.” Cf. V.
44, “ quoniam sordent tibi munera nostra.'’

29. ιήζτμηί) cervos, “ to shoot the stags.¹’ Cf. Georg. Ι. 308, “tum figere
dan1as.’'

30. yreyem compellere, “to drive the fiock.” So Hor„ Od. Ι. x. 18,
uses the verb coercere :

. . . virgaque levem coerces
Aurea turbam.

hibisco, “with amarsh—mallow rod,’' i. e.‚ with a shepherd's crook.
The plant hibiscum is said to be the Althoea officinalis of botanists.

32. Pan primus. Here Pan is described as the inventor of the Pan's-
pipe, or Pandean pipe, the peculiar musical instrument of shepherds.
It consisted of hollow stems, generally seven in number, fastened
together with wax. These stems were of cane, reed, or hemloek,
according to circumstances. Cf. Ecl. VIII. 24, ⁴⁶ Panaque qui primus

calamos non passus inerte-‘32' The Greek term was σῦριγξ, and the Latin
fislula. Cf. Hor. Od. IV. xii. 10:

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium
Custodes ovium carmina fistula.

34. trivisse labellum, “ to have rubbed your lip,’' i. e.‚ with exet-eise,
in learning to play upon the pipe.

35. hoec eadem, &e.‚ “to learn this very art, what did not Amyntas
do'.l ” i. e.‚ what lahour did 110 §pare in learning to play‘.l

36. disparibus cicutis, “ with unequal hemlock-stalks.''
