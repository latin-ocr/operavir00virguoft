[Non est idem iusereie quod et oculos imponde. Servius] Here the
poet shows the difference between grafting and inoculating. Inocu-
lation, or budding, is performed by making a slit in the bark of
one tree, and inserting the bud of another into it. There are several
ways of grafting now in use3 but the only one which Virgil describes
is what we call dest-grafting, which is performed by cleaving the head
of the stock and placing a scion from another tree in the cleft.
(Martyn.) The place where this “dest” is made, is where the bud
(variously called nodus, yemma, or ‚qm-men) bursts out and appears
above the bark of the mee—ramis felicibus (ε ramis feracibus), ‘¹ with
fruitful boughs,”
