364. Pyfflnalionis spes. The treasure which was the object of Pygma-
lion‘s desire—on which he had fixed 1115 eyes.

367. Byrsam. From the Greek βύρσα, “a hide.”

374. ante, ὡς. “ Evenlng would close the day ere all were told.''

Trapp.

394. Jovis ales = aquila, “the eagle.” For ales see Latin Deiectus,
. 53 note.

p 402 —417. avertens. Understand se.—ambrosioe comte. The gods were
accustomed to auoint themselves with ambrosia. In Geor. IV. 415,
Aristaeus is represented as being anointed with ambrosia by his mother
Cyrene to enable 111111 to sustain an interview with Proteus. In AEn.
XII. 419, Venus is represented as applying the same substance as an
emollient ‘co the wound of AEneas. Ambrosia was also the fabled food
of the gods, as nectar was said to be their drink. The derivation of
the word is from a privative and βροτός, “ mol-tal ; ” either because it
was a dainty of which mortals were not allowed to partake, or else be-
cause those who consumed it were thereby rendered numm-tak—incessa
patuit Dea. See note on v. 45, above.—Sabceo. See Geor. Ι. 57,
and note.

445. facilem victu, “easy to conquer,” i.e. ready or successful in con-
quest. The expression is epexegetical to bello effreyiam: the supine is
also to be taken in an active signification, as in Pliny, ep. V. 6, 3 3 “quae
et tibi auditu et mihi relatu jucunda erant.’' But others reg-ard victu
as the supine, not of vincere, but of vivere, and explain the words as
indicating the possession of abundance of the means of subsistence.
But facilc vivere 15 said only of those who do not suffer from the pres-
sure of want, not of those who luxuriate in superfluity. Moreover‚ the
horse is not the type of fruitfulness and plenty, but is the constant
symbol of war. Thus Ladewig: but there are many commentatam-S
who support the view which he rejects.

450. timorem. AEneas was anxious about the reception which Dido
would give him, for Venus had merely announced to him the safety of
his companions.

455. inter se. These words are probably to be joined with miratur,
and indicate that AEneas instituted 501110 comparison between the
various works of art before him.

458. ambobus, “ to both parties.''—laudz' is put for that which
deserves praise, ‘circata-tibi is dativus ethicus.

466—494. hdo—Mc, “ on one side—on another side'’ of the temple-
wall. The subjects of the paintings are thus enumerated by Virgil:
(1) the victory of the Trojans under Hect0r3 (2) the victory of the
Greeks under Achilles3 (3) the death of Rhesus; (4) the death of
Troilus3 (5) the Trojan matrone 111 their procession to the temple
of Pallas; (6) Priam begging Hector's bodyg (7) the conibat of
Me1nnon; (S) the Amazone in battle. Thus we have depicted two
victories, two deaths, two suppliant-scenes, and two 0000001015.-
priusquam yusldsseozt. According to an oracle Troy was never to be
taken if once the horses of Rhesus should have drunk of the waters of
the Xanthus or grazed on the Trojan mains—crinibus passis, ⁴· with
hair dishevelled.’' This was a mark of sadness: usually the women
wore their hair tied up in a knot.—lunati3, Shaped like a half-moon.—
exsmtoe = nudatae.
