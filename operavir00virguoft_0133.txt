THE BUCOLICs.——EGLOGUE 11. 123

the Latin acu-men, acu-tum, ac-ies. Pott (Etym. Forsch.) defends the
root cae, and compares the Sanscrit siklzd, “ cacumen.”

4. incondita, “ill put together, incoherent.'' Livy, IV. 20, uses the
word with reference to rude, extemporaneous verses 3 ‘⁶ in eum milites
carmina incondita canere.'’ This is a good instance to show that the
negative in· may have the force of ill-, evil-, &c- So infamis, “ill-
famed;'' ‘in-tempestus, “ill-timed‚ un-seasonable;” ivl-fortunium, “ill-
luck, mis-fortune.” The English un- is sometimes so used, and the
German un· constantly so 3 as Un-kraut, “an evil weed;” Un-gliick,
“ un-luck,” z'.e. ill-luck.

5. montibus jactabat. Instead of the dative, we have (Ecl. V. 62)
ad with the accusative: “voces ad sidera jactant.” The meaning is,
that he was singing to the mountains and foreste, and wearying all
nature with his lamentations.

6. nihil mea σαι mina caras? “art thou utterly regardless of my
songs‘?” carmina is the accusative governed by curctS, and nihil is
employed like many other neuter accusatives as id, quod, hoc, unum,
δῖα, without any direct government, and almost adverbially.

9. spineta, “the thorn-heclges.” The termination -etnm is commonly
found with words which denote a collection of plants or trees; as
oescul-etmn, dum-etam, fruticetam, pin-etum, querc-etum, vin-ermm-lacer-
tos, “lizards.’' The usual form is feminine, lacerta; and lacertas
generally means an “ arn],⁷’ or “ shoulder.'' But the masculine is some-
times found in the sense of a “ lizard.'' Cf. Georg. IV. 13,

Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti.

10. rapido cestu, “ with speedy haste; '⁹ literally, ⁴⁴ with rapid glow.'’
So Heyne explains it, ‘⁴ vehemente, rapido cursu.”

11. allia serpyllumque, “ garlic and thyme.''

12. tua dum vestiyia lustro, “while I mark your footsteps.” Cf. AEn.
XI. 763, “ et tacitus vestigia lustrat.’'

mecum raucis . . . resonant arbusta cicadis. Here mecum must mean,
“in unison with me.'’ Cf. AEn. I. 675,

Sed magno AEneae mecum teneatur amore,

“ lat her be held, as I am, with great love for AE‘neasss' So ΔΈῃ. IV. 1] 5,
mecum esic iste labor, ‘⁴ Ι will join in that work of yours.'' And Hor.
Ep· I. Ἦ. 67, Si quid novisti rectius istis,

Candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum.

“ If you know anything better than those, frankly tell me ; if not, use
these as I slo.⁷' For the ablative with resonare, see note on Ecl. Ι. 5.-
cicada is translated ‘¹ g1·asshopper,'’ “ tree-cricket‚” or “ cagal ; '' it is an
insect common in warm climates, and begins to sing during the heat of
the day, from about ten o'clock in the morning. Cf. Georg. ΙΙΙ. 327,

Inde, ubi quarta sitim coeli collegerit hora,
Et cantu querulae rumpent arbusta cicadae.

15. ,ἶαειὶάτζυ-τ “dislike, insolence;” literally, loathing. So Hor. Sat.
ΙΙ. iv. 78, “ magna movet stomacho fastidia.''
