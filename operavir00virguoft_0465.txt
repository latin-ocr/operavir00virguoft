THE faunum—Boon 1v. 267

178. ’ἵνά irrisam Deorum. Because the gods had cast her children,
the Titans, into Tartarus. Virgil here, in common with many other
poets, confounds the Titans and the Giants; for whilst O'aem»= was
numbered among the Titane, Enceladus was included among the Giants.
The hostilities carried on by the Titans were directed against Saturn 3
the Giants waged war against Jupiter.

213*215. cui loci (esses dedimus, ‘¹ on whom we conferred jurisdiction
over the place.''-ac dominum . . . recepit, ‘⁴ and has received AEneas into
her realnis as her [ον ⁵ their ⁵] lord.''—ille Pam‘s, “ this Paris of afellow‚'¹
= mollis ille T1·ojanus‚,qualis Paris apud Hom. Il. Ι. 391, sqq.

243. mittit, πέμπει, ἄγει. See note on Lucian’s Dialogues, p. 106 -et
lumina morte resiynat. Is the verb in this sentence to be translated
'‘re-closes, closes again,’' or “ un-closes, opens '⁹2 If we choose the
former interpretation, we regard <morte as the ablative of instrument;
“and closes once more the eyes in death.” Resiynat, says Ladewig,
who adopts this rendering, is used with a reference to the preceding
(lat somnos adimitque : as he gives sleep to the eyes. and takes it away,
so he closes them again through the instrumentality of death. This
explanation is, however, by no means generally received. Some com-
mentatore, among them XVagner, suppose an ellipsis of the preposition
a before morie, as is common after verbs compounded with re‚and
translate “unseals the eyes from death.’' Davidson's version is, “and
opens the eyes which death had sealed.’' Dr. Trapp translates, “ Gives
or breaks sleep. and eyes unseals from death.” And Dryden,

“ With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight;
And eyes, though closed in death, restores to light.'¹
If this last interpretation be correct, it does not necessarily follow that
any allusion is intended to the Roman custom of opening the eyes of a
deceased person when stret-ched on the funeral pile; there may be

. merely a reference to some part of the god's own functions, as ψυχαγω-

γός, or “quide of spirits.''

300-303. “She rages, dispossessed of fortitude, and, all-inflamed,
she roams wildly through all the city; like a Bacchanal, roused to
enthusiasm by the opening of the ceremonies [i.e.‚ of the triennial
Bacchanalian festival celebrated on Mount Cithaeron, near Thebes]⁷
when, on her hearing the name of Bacchus, the triennial orgies urge
her on, and Cithaeron at night invites her by its elam0u1-.’' Sacra
commovere, or movere, was an expression applied to the making a com-
mencenient of the festival.—Bctc<·lzo audito. That is, when the cry of
“ Io Bacche ! '¹ was taken up—lrieeerica is a Latinised form of the Greek
τριετηρικοί, from τρεῖς, “three'’ and ἔτος, “a yea1·.''—noctm·nus. These
orgies were celebrated by night.

415. ne quid, &c., “lest by leaving any means [of detaining AEneas]
untried‚ she should throw away her life gratuitously ;” i-e., when she
might have lived happily with the object of her passion had she
employed the neglected means of detaining him.
