ECLOGUE IX.—MOERIS.

ARGUMENT.-—Moeris recounts to Lycidas the missortunes of Menalcas,
who had been ejected from his lands. Menalcas had distinguished
himself in poetica] composition, and the dialogue turns upon poetry in
general, each reciting passages, as his memory serves him. The frag-
ments recited are chiefly translations from Theocritus

1. quo te pedes? sc. ducunt : ‘⁶ whither do your feet lead you'? ’' i. e.
whither are you going? Cf. Theocr. XIV. 42, ᾇ πόδες ἆγον.

have come to this, that a sti-anger holding our little farm could say‚'’
&a ; i. e. we have lived to hear a strange proprietor say, &c-

6. quod ‘nec bene vertat, “and may it not turn out well for him.'’

himself, who, by his poetical merit, obtained the privilege of being
spared in the general confiscation.

could ward off the bruta] insolence of military aggression.

sense of “ cutting into, cutting short, putting an end toss'
