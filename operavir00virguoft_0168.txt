stones upon the unpeopled earth; whence sprung mankind, a flinty
race. Therefore I pray you, immediately at the commencing months
of the year, let the stout oxen turn up the 'rich soil of the earth, and let
the pulverising summer heat mellow the exposed clods with ripening
suns. But ifthe ground have not been productive it will be sufficient to
lay it up in shallow furrow even under Arcturus: in the one case [i. e.
with the pinque solum, the course I have prescribed must be adopted]
lest weeds obstruet the thriving fruits; in the other case [that of the
tellus ozon ⁸scczmda] lest the scanty moisture forsake the barren sand.”

62, 63. Deucalion, &o “ Ancient fable divided the period of man's
early history into four ages; the golden, the silver, the brazen, and the
iron age. 111 the first, the golden age, we are told by the poets that
the whole earth was the abode of peace and happiness justice and
integrity universally prevailed without the existence of laws to enforce
them, war and disease were alike unknown, the rivers flowed with milk
and nectar, the very oaks dropped honey, and a perpetual spring
flourished. At the expiration of this happy period, mankind began to
deteriorate, and nature gradually altered her aspect. The iron age saw
the world arrived at the height of wickedness and depravity 3 where-
upon Jupiter determined to destroy the degenerate race of men, and
sent a fiood, from which only two persons, Deucalion and Pyrrha, were,
on account of their piety, suffered to escape. An orac-le afterwards
directed them to re-people the earth by throwing the bones of their
mother behind them. By the bones of their mother, stones of
“ mother '’ earth were meant. They did as was enjoined. The stones
thrown by Deucalion became men, those thrown by his wife, Pyrrha,
became women. It is unnecessary to point out the resemblance
between the former part of this suble, and the more truthful narrative
of a passage in the early history of the world to be found elsewhere?

71—83. “ In alternate years you, the same, shall permit the newly
dug land, cleared of its crops, to lie idle, and the languid plain to
recruit itself by rest. Or, in a subsequent season, you shall sow the
yellow corn in that ground (ibi) from which you shall have previously
removed the ripe pulse with its shakmg pod, or the produce of the
slender vetch, and the brittle stalks of the bitter lupine, and the
rustling wood. For a erop of flax exhausts the pluin; a crop of oats
exhausts it; poppies‚ saturated with Lethean sleep, exhaust it: but

with rich manure the dried-up soil, and to scatter the unclean ashes
