GEORGIC 1. 1 5 9

disadvantage of unploughed [τ e. of unemployed, and, consequently
nonproductive] land.”

71. tonsas appears to mean, in full, “ cleared of crops and rubbish.’'
Keightley translates tonsas novales, ‘⁶ the reaped fields ς ” adding,
‘¹ reaping is called slzearings iu Seotland and the north of England.'’

73. mutato sidere. At a. different season of the succeeding year, for
the pod-fruits mentioned in the two next verses require a different
seed-time. One MS. reads ‘⁴ mutato semine.‘’

78. Lemaeo . . . somno. Compare Geor-gie IV. 545. The narcotic
quality of the poppy is well known. Cf. note on line 212.

81. effoetos. This adjective is applied to what has brought forth
young, and frequently implies either present exhaustion from the pa'ms
of labour, or permanent deprival of the power of parturition.

83. The strictly literal rendering of this line appears to be this ι
mc (nor) est (is there) interea (iu the mean time) nulla-qratia (the un-
p1·0fitab1eness)inaratoe terrae (of unploughed land). Virgil wishes to
impress upon the husbandman the fact that, by a proper alternation
of crops and a pleutiful supply of manure, the productive capabilities
of the land may be continuously maintained, and the costly necessity
obviated of suffering it to lie in fallow.

84—93. “ Osten, also, has it proved beneficial to fire the reaped
fields, aud to burn the light stubhle with the crackling flames :
whether it be that, from that process, the land acquires unobserved
strength and fattening nutriment3 or that every fault is sweated out
of it by means of the fire, and that the superabundant moisture evapo-
rates ; or that the heat opens more passages and hidden pores for the
sap to find its way into the tender plants,¹ or that it rather consoli-
dates it, and eontraets the gaping veins, lest the drizzling showers
should do injury, or the too violent power of the scorching sun
should parch them up, or the piei-cing eold of Boreas chill them.”

84. steriles. This adjective contains the root of the Greek στερεΐν,
“to deprive.” Itis here applied to fields which have been deprived
of their cropS, the corn having been reaped and carried off.

85. This line is wholly composed of dactyls with the exception of
the sixth foot: atque lelvem stipuilam crepiltantibus Ι urere Ι flammis.
This structure is adopted probably to express the rapidity with which
the flames spread over the field and consume the stubble. [The term
dactylas is applied to a metrical foot consisting of one long syllable
followed by two short syllables. The primary meaning of daelylus is
‘⁶ a finger ;'’ and as this member is composed of one long joint and two
short ones, the extension of signification is easily accounted fou]

86. pabula. The commentators generally suppose, that when the
poet speaks of this nourishment to be derived from the fire, he alludes
to the philosophy of Heraclitus, that all things are created out of
fire. La Cei-(la, with better reason, thinks, that he means the noui-ish-
ment proceeding from the ashes. (Mai-tyn.)

88. vitium. Compare note on Cornelius Nepos, Themistocles, Ι. p. 96.

92. tenues pluvioe. I have virtually adopted the interpretation of Lm
Cerda; ‘⁶ pluviae, quae tenuitate sua, penetrant '’ Servius renders,
“inutiles pluviae ;'¹ aud Solu-evenus, “tenuitas pluviaru1n.’'

93. adurat. Here we have an instance of zeugma, or the junction of
one verb to several nominatives, to one or more of which it is not
