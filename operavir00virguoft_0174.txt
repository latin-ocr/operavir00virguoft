then—so, at least, Vin-gil appears to imagine—retain 11115 form as it.
grows, and be ready-fashioued to the workman's hand when, after the
lapse of a certain time, he comes to cut it down. Observe that
continuo is in close connexion with in sylvis, and translate thus: “at
once, while yet in the woods, [2'.e., while yet growing]y the elm, bent by
great exertam, is forced* into the shape of a buris, and receives the
forn] of the bended plough.” The buris being the stock—-the main
picce——of the implement, Virgil correetly enough speaks of the tree
bent into the forn] of a buris as receiving the shape of the plough itself.
—The buris—the body, or beam of the plough—having been prepared,
the next thing was to attach to it the temo, “polef’ Translate, “to
this [huic sc. buri] is fastened [aptatur understood] a pole projecting to
a distance of eight feet from the origin.” I do not porceive any
objection to taking ab stirpe as referring to the point ofjunction of the
temo with the buris, that is, to the inner end ot' the temo itself. It is,
however, commonly referred to buris alone, and taken 10 mean ·‘ from
its upper end.'’ To the outer extremity of this temo the yoke was
fastened.—am·es. There were two of these “ earth-boards, mould-
boards” on each side of the baris. They proj ected froin it like
“ears,” (whence the Latin name aures), or like “wings,” (whence the
Greeks called them strepuit—dentalia is plural with singular meaning:
“the tooth of the plough with its double surface.” The <lenacia
seems to have been made of wood generally plated with iron, to have
been fastened 10 the lower part of the front of the buris, and (probably)
to have consisted of two leaves or arms or wings meeting in a point
and forming an acute angle with one another on the side away from
the temo and towards the ploughman.— Caeclitur . . . imos. “Previously‚
too, is cut down the light lime-tree for the yoke, and the lofty beech,
and a handle to turn the bottom of the running machine behind.” It
both the text adopted (which is that of all the Manuscripts), and the
rendering furnished be correct, then virgil says that the lime-trce is to
be cut down and the plough-yoke to be made from it3 he says that the
beech is to be cut down, but does not tell us what is to be done after-
wards with 113; and he says that the plough is to have a handle, but
does not tell us what sort of tree is to be cut down to furnish 13110 wood
for 113. Now there are two ways of removing this source of difficulty :
(1) by adopting the emendation stirne, the dative case, for stivaque; we
should then translate “and the lofty becch 15 cut down for a handle to
turn‚’' διας (2) Jahn suggests that the lime-tree oa beech is to be used
for a yoke‚ and that there is to be a handle, the sort of wood composing
which is not mentioned, being perhaps a matter of little importance.
In objection to 13110 first explanation, it may be observed, that, however
plausible the emendation, 113 15 purely conjectural: in support of the
second interpretation, 13110 reader may be reminded, that Virgil fre-
quently uses a copulative conjunctior] where we should expect, and
where the English idiom would iniperatively require, a disjunctive.
The literal rendering given above would, therefore, convey the poet's
genuine meaning more exactly by the substitution of “or the lofty
beech¹’ for “and the lofty beech.''—explorat, “ 10515, proveS, tries.'’

⁴* &Another reading is dometur, “let . . . be forced? instead of the indica-
tive omatur. '
