concludes that the kettlos or cauldrons are for the purpose of heating
water, in which they may wash, as usual, before commencing their
repast. There is, however. something in the note of Ladewig on the
passage, which is to this effect. In the heroic ages undoubtedly it was
the universal custom to roast the meat ; but Virgil -here transfers the
habits of his own generation to the earlier period, just as he does again
a little lower down by the words mem-ce remotae, which in this case
denote simply the conclusion of the meal. On the contrary, the poet
is faithful to the observances of heroic times when he represents the
conversation as comment-ing not until the end of the feast—vocatos, “ if
they were to be invoked.'' The entire line is a poetical circumlocution
for “ or, that they are dead.'’

would have required the subjunctive.

242—253. Antenor. Of the fate of Antenor, after the destruction of
Troy, Livy gives the following account: “Satis constat, Antenorem
cum multitudine Enetum (qui seditione ex Paphlrgonifi pulsi et sedes
et ducem, rege Pylaemene ad Trojam amisso, quaerebant), venisse in
intimum Adriatici maris sinum, Euganeisque, qui inter mare Alpesque

Timavus, from whose source there rushes through nine chaunels, with
a loud roaring of the mountain, an impetuous sea which overflows the
meadows with a boisterous sheet of water.” It must be observed that
fontem Timavi is for Timar-zoni, although wide. which follows, seems to
refer particularly to the former word, ,lintrem From its mountain
source the Timavus has a rapid and noisy course through nine chan-
nels : these converge into one river-bed, through which, after an addi-
tional course of less than a mile, the river disembogues itself into the
sea by a broad mouth. In consting along the Illyri-an shore, Antenor
was carried past the Sinus Tewyest'ioeus (Gulf of Trieste), into which the
