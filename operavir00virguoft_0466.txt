BOOK V.

1. In this book AEneas, having set sail from Carthage, is driven by a
storm to revisit Sicily. Here he instituted funereal games in celebra-
tion of the anniversary of his father's death. The Trojan women set
fire to the fleet 3 but, by the intervention of Jupiter, all the ships,
except four, are saved from destruction. The death of Palinurus takes
place upon the voyage to Italy-medium iter does not mean that he
had accomplished half his course, but that he had gained the open sea.
We read, in line 3, that the port was still in sight.

2. certus, “ resolute.’'

15, 16. “ He orders them to reef the sails, and to ply vigorously their
sturdy oarS, and he braces up the bellying canvas to the wind‚'' &c., so
that the ship may lie nearer the wind.

19. mutati transversa fremunt, “the winds roar in the oblique sails,”
that is, in the sails thus braced up.

28—32. flecte vicem velis, “change your course by the sails.'’ We
should say, square your ,ναν-(13, and run before the wind—seomidi. The
execution of this manoeuvre, and the change of course, make a fair
wind, not for the destination originally aimed at, but for Sicily.

37. horridus belongs as well to pelle as to jaculis, on account of the
shagginess of the beai-’s skin. The ancients believed that Africa pro-
duced bears.

69—'7 1. crudo coestu. Because the oses-cus, or boxing-glove was formed
of razo hides; or else on account of the bloody wounds it sometimes
inflicted—ore favecezfavete 1111ἕυίεεεύφημεΐτε. This was an injunction
to pay a striet attention to the celebration of the games or sacrifices 111
progress. On such occasions an avoidance of al] profane or ill-omened
expressions was strictly enjoined. The surest mode of compliance was
to refrain from speaking altogether3 and, therefore, the expression in
the text is frequently tantamount to a proclamation of silence and
religious attention.

7 2. materna myrto. The myrtle was sacred to Venus, the mother of
AEneas. Compare note, Geongic Ι. 28.

84—89. Compare Milton, Paradise Lost, IX. 96, sqq.

. . not with indented wave,
Prone on the ground, as since; bnt on his rear,—
Circular base of rising folds that tower’d,
Fold above sold, a surging maze,—his head
Crested alost, and carbuncle his eyes ;
With burnish'd neck of verdant gold, erect
Amidst his circling spines, that on the grass
Floated redundant.

119. urbis opus-:urbis instar. Compare note on ΙΙ. 15.·—versu. This
word means “a tier '⁹ of oars, running fore and afa—ordine refers to
the vertical line—the number of tiers of ears. virgil here again puts
into the possession of those who lived in the heroic ages, the inventione
of a later period ‚· for triremes were first built, according to Thucydides
