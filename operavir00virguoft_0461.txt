THE animum—BOOK 111. 263

19. Dionoeae matri, “to my Dionaeffl mother—to my mother, the
daughter of Dione,’' tle, to Venus. In consequence of being the mother
of Venus, Dione is sometimes spoken of as an ancestress of the Julian
race. Of. Ecl. IX. 47. -divisque : et ceteris Diis.

24. hastilibus. Why these myrtle-boughs are called hastilia, will
appear from verse 46. The shafts of spears and darts were, moreover‚
generally made of myrtle, but sometimes of cornel.

34—36. Nymphas venerabar ‹zm-estes, “ I began to supplicate the rural
nymphs.” AEneas conjectures that what he has done has been offen-
sive to some deity. He therefore addresses himself first to the nymphs
presiding over the busli-grown hillock‚ and then to Mars (Gradivumque
patrem), the tutelary deity of the count1·y.-(ut) secundarent visus, δια,
“to second what I had seen, and to qualify the omen.'' Two omens
were requisite in the process of divination. The second (omen secuml um),
if favourable, was held to nenti-alise the first. AEueas had seen a pro-
digy which he naturally considered to be of direful portent‚· he there-
fore prays for a second vision to qualify the character of the former.
and mitigate the calamities it prognosticated.—49, sqq. Cf. Eurlp.
Hec. 1, s .

62—63qE2y0, ἄτα, “Theref01‘e, [since his obsequies have not yet
been duly performed‚] we renew for Polydorus his funeral cere1no==ies‚
and a huge mound of earth is raised upon the hillock [i.e. the hillock
mentioned in v. 223 tumulo is the dative astera verb of giving] ; altars

- stand erected to his Manes, sad with dusky wreaths and sable cypiess;

 

and around stand the Trojan women with hair dishevelled, according to
the custom. We offer [on the grave] cups foaining with warni milk
and goblets of consecrated blood [ἵζε. of the blood of the victim]; and
we lay his soul to rest in the tomb, and with loud voice we raise the
last fai-ewell.'' It was an opinion currently entertained by the S⁹oics‚
that when the funeral obsequies had been formally gone through, the
soul returned to the body, and remained with it in the grave until dis-
solution had taken place.

102. veterum monumenta virorum, “the memorials—-the records—of
men of former times;” reports which he had heard of the decds and
destinies of the heroes of by—gone generations.

124, 125. Ortyssioe. Ortygia was the more ancient name of the island
of Delos.—Bacchalam jussis Naxon, ‘¹ Naxos, ou whose hills the Baccha-
nalian orgies are oft celebrated.'' Naxos was a distinguished seat of the
worship of Bacchus—nircum. This epithet is applied to Paros on
account of the snowy whiteness of the niarble produced there.

150—152. aute oculos jacentis, “before my eyes as Ι lay.''-insomnis,
“ awake.” But some editors read in soumis, “asle-eps But ..Encas says
below, v. 173, “ nec sopor illud erat‚‘” and,-moreover, he could see the
the moon. But much depends upon the manner in which risi is under-
stood—per insertas fenestras, “ though the openings made ’' in the wall
to admit the light, &c. insertas is a participle from inem-me.

223. in partem praedamque is by hendiadys for in partem prcedoe. Cf.
Liv. V. 21,· “Venientes ignari . . . jam in partem praelae suae vocatos
Deos.” A portion of the booty was always consecrated to the gods.

244. semiesum is here trisyllable; qu. semfflsam.

255—258. The reader should bear this prediction of the Harpy in
mind. Its realisation appears in AEn. VII. 116, sqq.
