 

THE AENEID.—*1}O‹)K 1. 215

In like manner Homer (Iliad Ο. 229) represents Jupiter as enffirusting
his mgis to Apollo; and in that sublini. passage of the Ilm-1 coin-
meneing Ε. 733, Minerva is represented as <tasting off her meldim, and
arraying herself in the same arinour of ‹limitem—united. The penulti-
mate of genitives in ias (illias, τ’]ιείιιθ, alterius, (ro.) is frequently short-
ened. But alius, the genitive, always has the ilong, to distinguish it
from the nominative.

45. Ast, which is the same in signification as al, is used here to suit
the requireinents of the metare—incedo. This word is more thau
equivalent in inere meaning t¹o sum, besides being more suita} ¹1e to the
dignity of epic verse. The majesty of gait which characteri-sed the
goddesses, Juno in particular, is often alluded to by the poets. Com-
pare [Eneid I. 4053 “et vera incessit patuit dea : ” and Propertius 11.
ii. 6; “incedit vel Jove digna soror '’ (i.e. like a second 511110).-
Jovisqae et soror et conjnsc. Compare Iliad n. 432, where Jupiter, the
son of Satum, addresses Juno, his κατιγνήτην ἄλοχόν Te: and Iliad Δ.

49. prceterea (= posthac) is here used of time, as in Georgic IV. 502.

50, 51. Austris. This birthplace of storius, AE=›lia‚ was pregnans}
with blasts from all quarters; bnt Ana-zeo- is specitied particularly as
being the most violent and destructive in the Mediterranean Sea.—
A? vlia was one of the Insulae Vulcaniae. and was situated north-east of
Sicily, There are seven of these islands, but Homer was arquainted
with the existence of only one. They are now generally known as the
Lipari Islands. The young student must heware of eonfounding the
AEolia spoken of here with the country of the same name in Asia Minor.

53. imperio premit. This· expression well denotes the rigour and
severity of the rnle exercised by AEolus over his restive subjecte, the
winds. Cf. AEnoffl, 1. 285, and X. 54.

58. 7ιῖ faciat, “if he were not to do so.‘’-qm'ppe rapidi (venii)
feram, ‘¹ forsooth they would,'’ &Q—profcmdum, “ lofty.'' Here used
for altam.

61, 62. insuper. Some translate this “ beddes, moreover, in addition
(= prcerereoe);'' but it seems preferable to join insuper with imposuit.
Compare AEneid III. 579, 580; and Livy, XXI. 1, “stipendio etiam
insuper imposito;'’ and XXI. 45, “castellum insuper imponunt.''——
foedere certo, “by a standing law.” Compare Georgic Ι. 60; aeterna
foedera.

63. premere, “ to oheek‚ to curb *aliems-jassus, se. a Jove. Wakefield
conjectures jus-lus.

65. The sentence introduced by namque states the consideratione

which indueed Juno to make direct application to AEolus. Cf. AEn. Ι.
731, and VH. 195.—mxzdcereflzcctzhs et comm-e (eos) vento.
- 68 Iliam in Italiam portans. Cf. Ovid, Fast. IV. 251, “Quum
Trojzina AEneas Italos portant in ag1·os.”-swbme7·sas obrue. Compare
the exclamation of Richard: “There let him sink, and be the seas
on him.’'

70. asse diversos, “ drive them in different directions—seatter them.”
diversos (masculine) refers to the Trnjans, and agrees with eos under-
stood. But some read diversas, either in agreement with puppa, or as
equivalent to in diversas parces. The last explanation seems very forced
and unnatural.
