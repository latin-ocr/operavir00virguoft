makes the Destinies address their spindles and say, “Ages like these,
run on Ε ”

48. «yssi-edere, 810. He invokes the boy, bidding him “enter upon
his high honours.”

49. Jovis incrementum, like the Greek θρέμμα Διός,

58. Pan etiam. . . . Pan eliam Arcaslirf, “ Pan, too, if with Arcadia
for umpire, with me he should eontend, Pan, even though Arcadia
was umpire, would own himself conquered.'' It seems better to make
etiam qualify Pcm 111 the first line and Arcadia in the second. But
this is a matter of taste.

60. risu. There are two interpretations of this word, “with a
smile,'’ or “ by a smile,'' and the question is, whether the smile is that
of the mother or the child. If “ by a smiles it must be “by lter
smile,” namely, the mother's: if “with 3 smile,'' it must mean the
boy’s. A critical friend has suggested that the latter interpretation
would require cum risu ,· and v. 62, *‘ cui non risere parentes,’' tellsagainst
it. It seems best to explain risu of the mother z “ to recognise thy mother
by her smile.” But from the earliest times the interpreters have
disputed over this passage, and written learnedly 011 both sides.

61. tulerant. In this word the e is made short—tssserunt.

62. Incipe, &c. The poet soretells the future by alluding to what
has not yet taken place: the parents are waiting to smile upon the
boy, the gods will welcome him to their feasts, and a goddess will
admit him to her conch.

63. nec deus, &c.‚ “nor god hath deemed him worthy of a banquet,
nor goddess of a coueh.” digsozcwi governs 311 accusative of the person
honoured, and 311 ablative of the thing wherewith he is honoured. So
AEn. I. 335, “haud equidem tali me dignor honore:’‘ ib. XI. 169,
“quin ego non alio digner te funere.’' Cf. Ovid, Met. I. 194,

Quos quoniam coelo nondum dignamur honore.

ECLOGUE V.——DAPHNIS.

ARGUMENT.—Two shepherds, Mopsus and Menalcas, challenge each
other to a musical contest (V. 1—19) : Mopsus begins aud bewails the
death of Daphnis (V. 20—44): Menalcas sings the heavenly life of
Daphnis ancl his admission into the society of the gods (V. 56-80).

The death of Daphnis was a favourite subject with the pastoral poets
(Cf. Theocr. Id. I.); as also was the death of Adonis. In each case
the subject was the fate of a beautiful youth who came to an untimely
end. The legend is supposed to be of Phoenician origin. So Milton
says (Paradise Lost, Book I):

Thammuz came next behind,
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his sate
In ainorous ditties all a summer’s day;
While smooth Adonis from his native roek
Rau purple 'to tho sea—supposed with blood
Of Thaniniuz yearly wouuded.
