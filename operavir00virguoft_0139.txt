THE BUC0L1cs.——ECL0GUE 111. 129

*ecusative transversa is used absolutely, that is, it does not depend

immediately for its government upon any other word in the sentence,
but is used almost as an adverb. Cf. AEn. V. 19:

Mutati transversa fremunt, et vespere ab atro
Consurgunt venti.

10. tum credo quum me ἰ-ἱῑίἒνε, &o Menalcas replies ironicassy, and
with reference to some inalicious conduct of his opponent. “ Oh! I
suppose it was at the time when they saw me cutting,⁷' Sne—arbustum
is explained to mean “ the shrub or small tree‚” to which the young
vines were trained, and which some one had spitefully cut through.—
vide-e, as the quantity shows, is the 3 pers. plur. of the perfect.

13. quse lu . . . et . . . dolebas, et, &c.‚ “which you both grieved
for, when you saw them given to the boy, and,” &c.: the accusative
quoe depends upon dolebas, and denotes the object regretted.

15. si non nocuisses . . . mortuus esses. On this use of the subjunc-
tive, see Key‚ Gr. ἓ 1209—1213, compared with ἓ 1153. And observe
the use of the past perfect tense, as contrasted with that of the past
imperfect, as in Ovid, Met. VII. 18, “ si possem, sanior essem ’“ In a
passage of Phaedrus (I. 3> the force of each tense may be noticed :

Contentus nostris si fuisses sedibus,

Et quod natura dederat voluisses pati,
Nec illam eoepertus esses contumeliam,
Nec hanc repulsam tua sentiret calamitas.

16. sures. Servius says that the word is here used as in the comio
poets, for sewi. XVagner takes it literally3 “what can masters do,
when thieves are so impudenti ’'

18. eoec'z'pere. The imperfect infinitive, “ catchfflg, or trying to catch.''
The word is used in Phaedr. I. 11, “ut feras fugientes ipse exciperet.”
—Lycisca‚ the name of the watch-dog.

19. ille, “that fell‹w yonder.’' He is addressing Tityrus, and of
course ille refers to a third party, at some little distance from both.

20. post carecta, ‘· behind the sedge-plots.’' carex is· 1·eed-gra:<s‚ or
sedge; carectum, “ a place covered with sedge :'’ compare filie-tum,
Jrutee-tum salic-tum, and also the words in -ειιιιη quoted in the note on
Eel. II. 9, spineta.

21. an mihi . . . ‘non redderet ille, quem meruisset fistula caprum?
“Do you mean to say that he was not to give up to me the goat which
(as I maintain) my pipe had won ἲ ” In this question we have the iniplied
opinions of the two disputants. and so we may accountfor the subjunctive
mood in each line. So Aristides, “nonne ob eam causam expulsus est
patria, quod praeter modum justus esset? '’—“ because (as they said) he
was just beyond measure.''

23. si nescis, ⁴* if you do not know, then I will tell you.’' Cf. Ovid,
Epist. xx. 150, ‘⁶ si nescis, dominum res habet ista sunni.''

25. tu illum? The verb is omitted; we may supply viciant-aut
unquam, &c. The question is αιιε unquam tibi fistula fait? “had you
ever a Pan’s-pipe Ί. ” and cerll'jlwlcla is merely an epithet equivalent to
the Greek κηρόδετος, “ wax-bound, joined with wax.” The Latin lan-
guage is poor in compounds. and here there is something peculiarly
awkward in putting cerd in one line, and juncta in the other. A pipe
